# Guiding Studentsâ€™ Research

The Rosenthal Library staff has developed a bibliographic instruction program for students enrolled in English 110 courses at Queens.  The goal of this program is to give students the framework and skills necessary to do research in a large academic library.  These skills include identifying, locating, and obtaining sources for a research paper.  Our role in the process primarily entails guiding students through the process of narrowing their topics and exposing them to methods of evaluating, analyzing, and synthesizing sources. Please contact Angela Rao at 718-997-3747 or angela.rao@qc.cuny.edu  to set up a library information session for your class. For questions about library sessions, contact Alexandra de Luise at 718-997-3748 or alexandra.deluise@qc.cuny.edu.  For more information on the library session, and other library information, see Appendix II.
