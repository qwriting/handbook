# Discipline

It is unlikely that you will ever encounter an overt disciplinary problem in your college teaching.  In the rare event that you do, refer that problem immediately to the directors of the program, who aim above all to ensure the safety and health of our shared workplace.

You are not expected to have to deal with abusive or disruptive behavior.  You, the teacher, are in charge of the orderly conduct of the class and may exclude any student or visitor who does not comply with a reasonable request in this regard.

Not all disciplinary problems are overt, however.  If you feel that a student or group of students is behaving in a way that is intimidating or disrespectful to you or to others in the classroom, or damaging to the learning environment of your class, consult the Directors for help in evaluating the situation and designing appropriate remedies. For this reason, we encourage any email correspondence with students to use QC email in case disciplinary issues arise.
