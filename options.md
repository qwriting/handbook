# Teaching Options in the Department of English

Graduate instructors and adjuncts teaching at Queens College have the opportunity to teach many other courses in addition to ENGL 110. Teaching schedules and assignments are determined by factors such as teaching experience, instructor preferences, specialized skills, and the programâ€™s needs.  

The department has a robust culture of curriculum development, and we share faculty resources on these blogs:
