# Appendix II: Rosenthal Library at Queens College

### Scheduling a Library Session

The librarians at the Rosenthal Library want to make your session(s) a valuable experience for your students and yourselves. There are a few points to remember when scheduling a class in the Library:

Please give the Library two weeks advance notice when requesting a particular Library session date. It is a good idea to have an alternate date in mind, in case the Library classrooms on the date you want are already taken.

The library sessions are most successful when the librarian is given the assignment at the time you are scheduling the class, so that he/she can plan and tailor the instruction to it. The generic classes with no assignment given tend to be less successful, both for the students and the librarian.

Due to the amount of information the librarians need to teach the students and the limited time available, Library tours are not given during the session. Instead, we request you tell your students to explore the Library website on their own, with its [explanatory text and Maps](http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/Library/information/maps.php/) to learn about our services and collections. When a physical tour is preferred, the Library will arrange such tours outside of the library session, through the Instructional Services Office upon request of the instructor.

Instructors are expected to remain with the class during the duration of the Library session.

Please tell your students to meet you directly at your designated Library classroom at the appointed day/time.

As a general rule, the faculty can expect the librarians to cover:

1. general orientation to the Library (service points, hours, where to do for help, stacks/call numbers for locating material)
2. library homepage and its organization
3. connecting from off campus 
4. distinguishing between popular magazines and scholarly journals
5. choosing a topic, broadening/ narrowing, Boolean searching,  keyword and subject searching
6. CUNY+ catalog ( locating books/e-books/journals in the catalog, CLICS service, My Account)
7. finding e-Journals 
8. periodical databases--identifying and performing searches in Academic Search Complete, Lexis Nexis (other as appropriate)
9. Evaluating information sources critically
10. Lab time 

Instructional Services Office (RO 224) is open Monday to Friday, 10am to 2pm.

Putting Materials on Reserve at Rosenthal<br>

### Reserve Collection: General Information

The Rosenthal Library's Reserve Collection consists of required readings assigned by Queens College (QC) faculty, reserve videos to be used in the Media Center, and other items. These collections can be accessed using your valid QC ID card and may be requested by CUNY+ Call number from the Library's 3rd Floor Circulation/Reserve Desk.

Information for Faculty: What You Must Provide
In order for your materials to be processed and made available to your students at the start of the semester, please follow these guidelines:

[One request form](http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/library/services/borrowing/reserves.php) — forms) must be submitted for each item you want on Reserve with a complete citation filled out on the form, your date needed by filled out on the form, a photocopy of the article or book chapter you are requesting (the Library does not photocopy), a syllabus for your course with your requests. Photocopies to be scanned must be very good quality and include a complete citation typed or clearly printed on the first page.

Submission Deadlines are generally 6 weeks before the start of the semester. Requests submitted after these deadlines will be processed on a “first come, first serve” basis—please keep in mind that new book orders may require up to several weeks to process. Material that must be located or recalled will require additional time.

Material which CAN be placed on Reserve
Books owned by the Library—to expedite your request please get the books from the stacks and bring them to the Level 3 Circulator/Service Desk.

Videotapes owned by the Library.

Personally owned videotapes (not duplicated videos); the Library is not responsible for loss of or damage to personal copies.

Personal copies of books (the Library is not responsible for loss of or damage to personal copies).

Photocopies of articles or book chapters you are requesting (the Library does not photocopy).
Course ephemera: Syllabus, assignments, etc.
Student papers—you must include a written permission signed by the student. For a copy of the form, click here: Student Papers Request.

Material which CANNOT be placed on Reserve
Library reference books or reference videos are not placed on Reserve; refer students to the Reference area or Media Center where materials can be used.

- Interlibrary Loan books.
- Library periodicals.
- Electronic Reserves Material

Materials may be submitted in paper format, or in an electronic format (Word, Excel, PDF, HTML)—either on diskette, CD, or as email attachments.

Lengthy documents will be broken into smaller parts to minimize downloading and printing time.

Reserve will NOT scan/place entire books on the E-Res site.

### E-Journal/E-Book Links

When an article is available in one of our electronic journals, instructors should indicate the appropriate database in their syllabus instead of placing the article on reserve. Reserve processing staff will review reading lists to determine if Rosenthal Library has electronic access to articles. Electronic journals are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (off-campus use requires setting up access through the QC proxy server; click here for proxy server setup instructions). To find out if the Library owns an e-journal search the list of E-Periodicals (A-Z).

If you find that a book you want to place on reserve is part of our netLibrary e-book collection, your students will be able to access it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from any Internet-connected computer provided they have set up an account. In order to set up an account one must visit netLibrary from a computer on campus. The username and password created may be used both on and off campus.

### Confirmation

Staff does not send confirmation regarding the receipt or status of the request. All instructors are encouraged to view the E-Res site to check on the availability of the requested material prior to assigning it to their students.

### Requested Semester Only

Material placed on Reserve will remain there for the requested semester only. Unless you request otherwise, all material will be removed from Reserve at the end of the semester: E-Res documents will be archived, Library material will be returned to stacks, and personal material will be returned to faculty.

### Password Protection

Passwords will be assigned for every course page. It will be the instructor's responsibility to disseminate the password to the students. Staff will not distribute passwords to students.

### Copyright Guidelines

The Library will comply with the current Copyright Guidelines for CUNY Libraries. Where materials do not fall within fair use, they may still be placed on Reserve providing permission is being sought from the copyright holder. The Library reserves the right not to accept materials for Reserve if it judges that the nature, scope or extent of the material is beyond the reasonable limits of fair use, and will not knowingly accept materials that violate copyright law. Where the faculty member has not already secured permission, the Library will work to a reasonable extent to obtain copyright clearance for material the Library places on E-Res. The Library will only pay limited permission fees. Instructors who manage their own E-Res course site must obtain copyright clearance for material they place on their site. Some material is prohibitively expensive to place on reserve electronically; in such cases, the Library will try to purchase a print copy.

### Course Paks

Faculty who wish to re-use copyrighted material for more than one semester or to place large numbers of copyrighted articles/chapters on E-Res might want to consider ordering a Course Pak through the QC Bookstore. Contact the Textbook Manager at 718-997-3570 for more information.

### Course Management by the Library

The Library will place material on reserve at the request of the instructor for the educational use of students. Free electronic access will be limited to the instructor and students. A copyright notice—for photocopied material and electronic material—will be available for each item. Access to material will be removed at the end of the semester.

### Course Management by You

Faculty wishing to manage their own E-Res course site must provide Reserve Processing Staff with a completed and signed Course Management Application. This includes assuming responsibility for copyright for the items you place on your E-Res course site. The following can be used as guidelines for copyright compliance: Copyright Policies and Guidelines for CUNY Libraries.

### Media Center 

The Multimedia Commons houses a variety of material, equipment, and facilities. Laptops for use by Queens College students can be borrowed here, and the Library's DVD, VHS and CD-ROM audio, video, and digital text collections are housed and screened on the media viewing workstations here. Microforms can be paged and used in this area and assistance is provided for the adjacent Educational Curriculum Center. We are open at all times the Rosenthal Library is open.

Almost all videos in the Library’s collection may be borrowed by all persons with Queens College Library borrowing privileges. Loan periods will vary from three hours to a maximum of seven days for most of the video collection: You may always come to the Queens College Library to borrow one.

Queens College Faculty who wish to use a video in their courses have two other options as well:

### CUNY Owned Videos in the Classroom

Queens College faculty may request any video owned by a CUNY Library including Queens College by using the request form available in the Library's Multimedia Commons.

Use CUNY+ to determine the title of the video as well as the CUNY school that owns it.

Be sure to provide at least one alternate use date in case it is unavailable for your initial requested time.

As many of these videos may be borrowed by others, we recommend at least three weeks advance notice.

The Library does not provide equipment for the classrooms. For a classroom showing make sure you also contact OCT to reserve viewing equipment (Kiely Hall Room 183, 718-997-5060).

Your video request will be confirmed by email as soon as we determine its availability.
Videos and the Reserve Library

Queens College Library videos may be placed on Reserve.

All videos placed on Reserve must comply with Library Reserve Guidelines.

Reserve Library video users have priority at most Library previewing stations.

Previewing stations may not be reserved.
