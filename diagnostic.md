# The Diagnostic Essay

You might choose to give a diagnostic essay, which is a short, preliminary writing assignment that is generally given within the first week of the course and is not submitted for a grade.  The assignment allows you to become familiar with and provide feedback about the skill and style of your students’ writing at the beginning of the course. The diagnostic essay may be impromptu or the prompt may be given ahead of time; it may be given as an in-class writing or as a take-home assignment; it can stand on its own or may be used as a sort of pre-writing exercise for a later, larger assignment.  It might be an academic essay, asking students to respond briefly to a class reading of some sort, or it could be something reflective: a detailed letter to you about their expectations for the course, for example.

The mention of a “timed writing” might cause your students some anxiety, so it’s generally a good idea to give them a full explanation of the purpose and procedure for the assignment a class or two in advance.  Once these assignments have been submitted, you should also review them for signs that a student has been misplaced in your course.  If a writing sample suggests that a student is placed in your course inappropriately, please show a copy of the sample to one of the directors of First Year Writing at once. Instructors should retain copies of the diagnostic as a sample of each student’s written work.
