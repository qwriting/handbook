# Copyright Issues

Below is a general guideline for copyright issues when duplicating and handing out articles and other published material in your class, and CUNYâ€™s official policy on copyright can be found [here](http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/la/copyright-materials/permission.html/). To avoid problems with duplicating costs and copyright issues, consider placing supplementary readings on reserve at the library (see Appendix II, Rosenthal Library). Class blogs or other sites where you make readings accessible to students should be password protected in order to avoid issues of copyright infringement.
