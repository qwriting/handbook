# After the First Semester

Near the beginning of each spring, you will receive an email asking you to fill out a preference form to tell us what you hope to teach next year. This form allows you to request to teach the classes listed below and provide us with your available teaching times and expertise.  The department will consider these requests and assign courses according to preference, schedule, expertise, seniority, and, when necessary, by rotation.

A few weeks after you turn in your teaching preference sheet, the department will inform you when your teaching assignments are available in CUNYFirst. You should check your schedule and confirm that you can teach the classes and times assigned.  It’s your responsibility to submit your course preference form by the deadline and to confirm your teaching schedule on CUNYFirst after it’s posted.
