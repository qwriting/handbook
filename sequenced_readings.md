# Developing Units of Sequenced Readings and Assignments

Our program website (http://english110.qwriting.org/) provides topics resources that include lists of readings to choose from and assignment sequences to adapt. Make sure to give yourself time to consider what you would like your students to take away from the classroom. Choose material that allows you to work with specific sets of skills and also material that allows for variety of subject matter. The next section contains a detailed description of the topics-based assignment sequences for 110.
