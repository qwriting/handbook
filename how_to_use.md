# How to Use This Guide

This handbook is divided into five sections.  This first introductory section covers the very basics, such as the goals of English 110, the kinds of support available to you, and the structure of the first year writing program.  This is all stuff that you should be familiar with before you begin teaching at Queens College.  The second section, “Class Documents: Syllabus and Assignments,” provides handy tips for generating the materials as well as samples of the syllabus and assignments that are necessary for the functioning of an organized course.  Instructors are meant to consult this section prior to the beginning of a semester teaching.  The third section, “Teaching Resources,” is a more free-form collection of materials and handouts that you may find useful in your own courses.  These range from tips for generating discussion to guidelines for responding to student work.  You may find yourself coming back to this section repeatedly throughout your teaching career here.  The fourth section, “Procedures,” and the Appendices (“Computing on the Campus,” “Rosenthal Library,” “Useful Queens College Information,” and “Useful Links, Handouts, and Sample Assignments”) are also meant to be on-going resources for you.  They are arranged topically so that you can find information on any procedural concerns that arise or further information on campus policies you may need.
