# The Cheating Aspect

The above CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity (revised July 1, 2011) addresses cheating and plagiarism.

Plagiarism is defined as "the act of presenting another person’s ideas, research or writing as your own” and is distinguished from purchasing papers from term paper companies or turning in another student's work, which is defined as cheating, rather than plagiarism.  The university considers plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty to be a serious breach of academic ethics.  Penalties range from a failing grade on the plagiarized work to failure in the course and dismissal from the College. You can also report the student in a way that only records the incident with the school without an institutional penalty (this allows the school to keep track of repeat offenders). Students have specific rights to respond to allegations before penalties are implemented, and to appeal penalties.  If you do come across a paper that you believe is plagiarized, attempt to find the sources(s).  Please do not make any accusations until you have talked with the directors of First Year Writing.  If you find convincing and demonstrable evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the directors will help you handle the situation in a way that is fair to the student and conforms to CUNY and Queens College guidelines. The Academic Integrity Violation Form, which you can find on page 87 in Appendix III, indicates the procedural steps implemented by Queens College’s Office of Student Affairs. 

While both instructors and students should take academic dishonesty seriously, discussions of plagiarism should also acknowledge its complexity as a wide range of practices with varying intentions.  Students' own confusion about what constitutes plagiarism may draw on wider uncertainties about the use and ownership of ideas.  Rather than addressing plagiarism only in terms of crime and punishment or honesty and dishonesty, instructors should encourage students to think about the varying conventions and expectations for using sources and give students opportunities to use and cite sources in different writing situations.  It is important to remember that much popular non-fiction in newspapers, magazines, and books—material students are very familiar with and that you might well be asking them to read—does not follow academic practices of citation.  In addition, the changing nature of conventions provides an opportunity to look critically at the University’s Academic Integrity policy as a class and determine how new practices and writing environments (such as in web bulletin boards, or other new online repositories for writing) might fit with or challenge current policies.

As the teacher, there are some practices you might adopt to deter cheating:

- Create specific, carefully crafted assignments to invite fresh and independent writing.
- Change significantly any assignment you do not create yourself.
- Discuss your students' papers with them at various stages of the writing process in conferences or informally in class.
- Schedule checkpoints for bibliographies, source evaluations, summaries, notes, and drafts, especially for the research paper, to head off any potentially troublesome cases.
- Have students document their research and writing processes with a number of short assignments (memos to you, in-class writing, annotated bibliographies, and the like).

If, despite your best efforts, you receive a paper that you suspect is plagiarized, please contact the Directors and remember to follow these steps: 

1. Please don’t accuse the student of plagiarism, or mention plagiarism as an issue to the student, until you have consulted the Directors.
2. If you can identify the source work for the plagiarized paper, and demonstrate plagiarism, please let the Directors know.  
3. The Director will help you work through the specific procedures to be followed in a plagiarism case and decide on an appropriate penalty.
