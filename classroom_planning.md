# Classroom Planning

Classroom planning not only helps you define what you are going to deal with in class, but also helps you clarify how you want to convey this material.  The following heuristic may help you prepare for class:

What do I expect the students to have learned by the end of the class hour?  What am I presenting today?  Putting these two questions next to each other helps us remember that the point of any activity is to enable student learning.  It’s a good idea to set specific and attainable goals.  To expect students to understand the difference between paraphrasing and summarizing a source after a class session is more realistic than expecting them to fully comprehend the Toulmin system of argument analysis after a fifteen-minute presentation.

How do I plan to go about presenting today’s material?  Which methods of presentation will I use?  Pedagogical staples discussed below include lecture, short writing exercises, class discussion, and group work.

What are my alternatives if one of my plans falls flat? This question is especially pertinent if you anticipate spending substantial time on discussion of a reading. If students are not prepared to discuss an article, be ready to turn that session into a collaborative reading exercise.

Do method and material combine into a fruitful learning process?  Straightforward how-to instruction, followed by student practice, makes more sense as a vehicle for some course material (the conventions of MLA citation style, for example) than discussion.  Conversely, students may learn less from a lecture on an assigned reading than they will from wrestling with the reading themselves in discussion and small-group work.

How much time do I want to spend on each section?  It’s not always easy, but you should keep track of the clock when you teach.  Try to find a balance between allowing for student response (and possible digressions) and meeting your goals for the day.

How does this particular class fit into the structure of the semester?  Students want and need to understand how one day’s lesson follows from the preceding class and leads into the next.  They also need to understand how the day’s work will help them with their current writing assignment.

Especially in the first few weeks of the semester, it makes very good sense to plan a few extra minutes of activities for each day.  Dismissing class twenty minutes early, because an activity didn’t work or everything you planned took less time than you anticipated, can be embarrassing, and it may cost a measure of good will from your students.  If you prepare more activities than you actually use, you’ll build up a file you can plunder later, and you’ll avoid any student perception that you’re underprepared.

While planning your class, you may want to break up your class period into short segments.  As you create an “agenda” for the day, try to provide a variety of activities (which in turn helps students remain alert).  Here is a sample class plan for a 75-minute Tuesday-Thursday class:

- 5 minutes: Lay out the agenda for the day to your students (this may sound self-explanatory to you, but it is crucial for the students’ understanding of the course as a whole); if possible, explain how today’s lesson relates to previous and/or future work; collect homework; use the blackboard to assign homework and/or outline the day’s agenda.  If you can, come to class a bit early: this is the time when some of your students will approach you with questions.
- 5-10 minutes: Assign a writing exercise; have the students respond to a question on the material they have read for today.
- 20 minutes: Lead a discussion on an assigned reading.
10 minutes: Present a mini-lecture about new rhetorical material.
- 15 minutes: Assign an exercise in conjunction with this new material.
- 5 minutes: Explain a new writing assignment. 
- 5-10 minutes: Ask students to sketch out a plan for meeting the goals set by the new assignment.
- 5-10 minutes: Ask students to work in pairs, sharing and explaining the approaches they’ve sketched.
- 5 minutes: Synthesize (have students summarize what has happened in class today, or summarize class material in closing mini-lecture).

As you can see, the above plan imagines that activities might take anywhere from 75 to 90 minutes.  If earlier activities run long, the next class can start with the activities devoted to exploring and discussing the tasks of the new writing assignment.

We help our students use the work that they do one day to help them the next day by making connections between activities. For example, in the above plan the instructor’s presentation of new rhetorical material could refer to the just-discussed reading for examples, and the following writing exercise might ask students to examine in detail how one of these examples operates.
