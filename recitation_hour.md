# How Will the Recitation Hour Work?

Historically, sections of ENG 110 have met twice a week for blocks of one hour and fifty minutes—just as they do now.  But that apparent stability masks a new development: the introduction of the “recitation hour” that is mandated by Pathways.  We’ve negotiated it to create a practice that suits our pedagogical goals for ENG 110, and this is how it works.

Every class period will functionally end thirty minutes before the stated end time, and you’ll spend that time meeting with your students in some configuration of small groups or conferences. So, let’s say that your class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:10-2:00.  You’ll have a regular class period from 12:10-1:30.  Then, you’ll let some portion of the students leave while you meet with the rest in some kind of workshop or conference.

The one requirement we receive from CUNY Central is that the entire class can’t stay for the entire 30 minutes every time.   Beyond that, each of us has to ask ourselves how we can maximize that time with our students. Below are some potential configurations for the conference hour.

### Conference Hour, Option A1

English 110 includes a weekly conference hour that is scheduled for half an hour after every class meeting. 10% of your final grade is based on your active, engaged participation in these conferences. During these conferences we will improve specific elements of academic writing. You should plan to attend one conference per week. After reviewing the schedule below, sign up for the conferences you will attend on the Google conference scheduling spreadsheet (the link is here and on the course website). Switching conferences at the last minute will be a real headache, so please be courteous and make every effort to keep to the initial schedule.

### Conference Hour, Option A2

Attendance at these conferences is required. 10% of your final grade is based on your active, engaged participation in these conferences. During these conferences we will improve specific elements of academic writing. You should plan to attend one conference per week. At the start of each week I will hand out/post to the course website a sign-up sheet so you can tell me which conference you will attend that week.

### Conference Hour, Option B (differentiated conferences)

English 110 includes a weekly conference hour that is scheduled for half an hour after every class meeting. 10% of your final grade is based on your active, engaged participation in these conferences. During these conferences we will improve specific elements of academic writing. Each student will be assigned 6 skill-building conferences that he or she must attend (in addition to starred conferences, which everyone attends). After an initial assessment, I’ll assign groups for conferences based on which ones I think will benefit you the most. Over the course of the semester, as I get to know your writing strengths and challenges better, I may change the groups I ask you to attend, so keep these time slots available.

### Conference hour, Option C

English 110 includes a weekly conference hour that is scheduled for half an hour after every class meeting. Each student will sign up for one of five writing groups that will meet with me every three weeks. During these conferences, we will talk specifically about your writing practices, class assignments, and the writing and research process. We will look closely at one another’s work during this time. You will need to read each group member’s writing in advance of the meetings. 

This is a time for more individualized instruction and attendance is required. The conference hour part of the class is 10% of your grade and you receive credit through attendance and engaged participation. No make-ups are allowed.
