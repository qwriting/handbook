# Parts of the Syllabus

The syllabus is comprised of two main sections, your course policies and a “syllabus” or list of dates and assignments for the semester. The amount of detail used in the syllabus varies from classroom to classroom. You will need to include specific assignments, readings, and due dates for the semester.

Included below are the different elements of the syllabus that you must include. See page 19 for a sample syllabus. These elements of the syllabus are required by the College and the state:

1. Course name, title, and section
2. Instructor contact information and office hours (for office hour requirements, see page 43)
3. Course meeting information
4. Course texts (required and optional, if any) and how they can be obtained (bookstore, course packet, Blackboard, class blog, etc.)
5. Course overview/description, which should be the topic description (found in the course overview). You might also include all or part of the bulletin description for English 110.
6. Course assignments/requirements (see page 15 for assignment parameters)
7. Attendance/class participation policy (see page 28)
8. Grade breakdown/grading criteria (see page 48)
9. Plagiarism/CUNY academic integrity policy (see page 55)
10. Linked course information
11. Writing Center information (see page 72)
12. Respectful conduct/language use policy
13. Late paper/make-up exam policy
14. Disability accommodations
15. A dated schedule of readings and assignments, draft and final paper due dates, and exam dates. The schedule can be a tentative one that is amended as you go along. See page 14 for hints on setting dates.
16. A list of Learning Goals separate from the course description. If you don’t like the term Learning Goals, you can use Course Goals, Goals, Course Objectives, or some other term that indicates to the students that the listed items reflect what the course will help them achieve. They are not “teaching goals,” however, and the individual goals should be worded in a way that is aimed at the students: for example, “You will learn . . . ,” “Students will be able to . . . ,” “The course will help students understand . . . ,” etc. For more information on Learning Goals, see page 12.
