At the Cirque Napoleon in Paris in 1859, Jules Leotard presented the first flying trapeze act. A contemporary account marveled at Leotard's "reckless breakneck flights from trapeze to trapeze like some tropical bird swooping from branch to branch." In case he fell, a padded mattress was spread the whole length of the stage. Eventually, the mattress was replaced by a net ... the old-fashioned rope net is the form of protection still used in the circus. "The net itself can be very dangerous," said Tito Gaona [a trapeze artist], "but it's a circus tradition. Our fans love to see us bounce from the net."

Paraphrased: According to John Culhane, the first flying trapeze act was in Paris in 1859. Jules Leotard swung from the trapeze like a tropical bird swooping from branch to branch, and audiences ever since have been thrilled by the daring man on the flying trapeze. To break his fall, "a padded mattress was spread" that covered the length of the stage. Even though technology has improved, the net is a circus tradition. Tito Gaona says that fans "love" to see them "bounce" from the net.

In [P.T.] Barnum's version, Jumbo laid down his own life to save the little clown elephant, Tom Thumb. Jumbo, wrote the master publicist, "snatched the little elephant from in front of the thundering train and hurled the little fellow twenty yards to safety." After he rescued Tom Thumb, wrote Barnum, Jumbo turned to face the oncoming freight.... "Jumbo ... gave but one groan after being struck and then assumed an attitude of determination and composed himself to meet death with a becoming dignity and fortitude." Millions of Americans, including those who had never seen Jumbo, mourned him as if they had lost a beloved pet and preferred to accept Barnum's version of his death.

Paraphrased: Barnum invented his own version of the death of Jumbo the Elephant. "Millions of Americans" were saddened by the elephant's death. They behaved as if they had lost a beloved pet, says Culhane. Barnum described how Jumbo met his death being very determined, with a "dignity" that elephants don't usually have, and fortitude.
