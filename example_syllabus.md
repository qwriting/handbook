Course Description: Our guiding assumption in this course is that higher education functions through a series of relationships, and that exploring them through writing will help us to contextualize the way we understand higher education in America as well as personal college experience. We can think of these relationships in different clusters or “frames”: as conversations between students, their families, and their teachers; between faculty and administrators; and between universities and the racial, ethnic, and geographical communities from which they draw. Through a progression of formal and informal writing assignments, we will contribute our voices to these conversations. One of the clearest ways that we can begin to understand what drives these conversations is to read and write about them in the context of the institution of which we are all a part: The City University of New York (CUNY). The process of observation, argument, evaluation, and revision that has driven changes in educational policy at CUNY is the same process that you will engage with as you participate in the interchange of ideas and information through your writing in this class. We will also explore the series of choices and circumstances that led to your decision to come to CUNY. What will be your relationship to this institution? How do your reasons for coming to college compare to generations of students who preceded you? How do your values converge with or diverge from the values of your university? 


Learning Objectives: By the end of the semester students will be able to

1) assess rhetorical context across different genres—evaluating them in terms of tone, stance, purpose, audience and visual design— and understand how this context works with ideas to produce the meaning of a text.
2) incorporate various methods of research into their written texts, including the use of secondary resources (both print and multimedia) and primary sources they have gathered themselves.
3) develop a vocabulary that will help them to analyze the structure and style of their writing, applying critical reading skills to their own texts and then articulating strategies for improvement.
4) make connections with other courses in terms of both content and methods of critical inquiry.

Assignments
As soon as you complete an essay, upload it to your personal blog. You will be reading from each others’ blogs on days when we have in-class writing workshops. When you turn in the final version of your paper (on the class following the writing workshop), you must hand me a hard copy. Then, upload the final version to your blog as well. As all of our assignments use secondary sources, a works cited page is required with every essay.

Assignment #1: “They Say” 
Format: Five-six pages. Deadline: 
Summarize the positions that Hirsch, Macedo and Loewen take on the issue of what students should learn in school. After discussing how their positions compare to and differ from one another, analyze an elementary or secondary school experience of your own that will allow you to “put in your oar” and explain your beliefs about how students should be taught history in school.  No direct quotations may be used in this paper. 

Assignment #2: As They Put It 
Format: Five-six pages. Deadline:
Choose one educational policy that you want to learn more about (“No Child Left Behind,” remediation, or affirmative action) as the focus for this essay. Quoting from various sources (those we have discussed in class and some that you find on your own), create a transcript of a debate between two fictitious individuals who are attempting to persuade the other of their opinion about this policy by citing relevant, reliable sources. 

Assignment #3: Saying Why It Matters 
Format: Five-six pages, plus Works Cited page. Deadline:
Write a letter to the Queens College Provost James Stellar inspired by the readings in this unit (“Education in America: The Next Generation”) that you have completed over the past two weeks. Your letter should present an argument that responds to the following prompt: How can Queens College offer an academic experience that is best suited to students of your generation? Describe two to three specific reforms that would make the Queens College experience more accessible and useful to you and your contemporaries. Finally, explain what the increasingly popular “corporate model” of schooling has to offer your generation of college students. 

Assignment #4: From the Inside Out: An Ethnography
Format: Eight-ten pages (final write-up). Deadlines: The stages and due dates of this sequence of assignments will be discussed in further detail as we progress.
An ethnography is a study of human social phenomena and social communities through the use of fieldwork (first-hand observation). To conclude this course, you will choose a group of people who have a stake in “higher education” (students, teachers, parents, etc.) and follow them closely for three to four weeks to record their beliefs, understandings, and social interactions in order to learn more about some debate in higher education and make an argument based on your conclusions. From initial proposal to bibliography to fieldwork to memos to final write-up, this project will be completed in stages. The first step is choosing your group; it is never too early to start thinking about the group or issue you want to study!  Feel free to approach me about this at any time.

Other Key Course Requirements 

1) Obtain access to the course blog (http://): Selected readings as well as announcements and assignments will be posted on this course blog. If you have never visited http://qwriting.org/ please visit the site and create a username and password. This will give you access to our class blog. 

2) Keep up with required writing assignments on your personal blog: Once you have signed up for a Qwriting,org account at http://qwriting.org/, you will be able to create a personal blog for use in this course this semester. The blog is yours forever. Treat it well and organize it clearly: make sure there is a page labeled “Weekly Assignments” and a section labeled “Essays.” (Other than that, you’re free to design it as you wish.) At the end of this semester, you may want to continue to add to it or adapt it for another purpose. Once you have created your own blog, this blog will be added to the “blog roll” for our course and will be open to the other members of the course and to me. This is not a private blog and should not be treated as such. The blog is a space for you to respond to the assignments on the syllabus and to develop your own relationship with the course material. Weekly blog posts will usually be about 300-400 words (please include a word count at the end of your post each week).  Your response to the weekly material must by posted by 9 p.m. every Sunday. Posting after the deadline will result in a deduction of points from your final course grade. 

3) Turn in polished hard copies of all four required essays. After you post your completed essays on your blog on the due date, these essays will be revised to display your most polished, sophisticated work. On the class following a writing workshop, hard copies of all revised papers must be turned in for a grade on the dates indicated on the schedule (then you can upload this final version to the blog as well). If you expect a grade on the assignment, both the electronic version and the hard copy must be submitted by the required due dates.  The lack of either will severely lower the assignment grade.  

4) Participation and engagement with the required recitation hour. 

Grading
Essay #1 (15 points)
Essay #2 (15 points)
Essay #3 (15 points)
Ethnographic research paper (25 points)
Active contributor status (20 points) 
**Important note: You will receive 1 point for each day you are prepared for class (i.e. have completed the readings and necessary blog posts or writing assignments). If you are not prepared with the required work due on a particular day, even if you are physically present, you cannot earn a point for that class. These points cannot be made up after a class passes. If you know in advance that you are going to be absent, missing work must be submitted by the end of the day on which class was held. If you are present and prepared for every class this semester, you can earn up to three extra credit points in this category, which will go toward your final grade.
Recitation hour (10 points)

Your final grade is out of 100 points. 
90-100 = A-/A   80-89 = B-/B/B+  70-79 = C-/C/C+  60-69 = D  Below 60 = F

Course Policies and Resources
Avoid plagiarism: Plagiarism is the act of presenting another person’s ideas, research or writings as your own. The following are all examples of plagiarism (though this is not an all-inclusive list):
Copying another person’s actual words without the use of quotation marks and footnotes
attributing the words to their source.
Presenting another person’s ideas or theories in your own words without acknowledging the source.
Using information that is not common knowledge without acknowledging the source.
Failing to acknowledge collaborators on homework assignments.
Internet plagiarism includes submitting downloaded term papers or parts of term papers,
paraphrasing or copying information from the internet without citing the source, and “cutting & pasting” from various sources without proper attribution. (http://web.cuny.edu/academics/info-central/policies/academic-integrity.pdf/)

Plagiarizing material on a paper in this course is grounds for failing that assignment. A second offense is grounds for failing the course. If you have any questions about what constitutes plagiarism, please ask me before an assignment is due. If I find that you have plagiarized, I am required to fill out the incident report and submit it to a college administrator.

Become an Active Contributor: You are a college student and an adult. Please take those roles seriously. You are expected to be respectful to me and the rest of the group, which includes coming prepared to class, contributing to class discussions in a thoughtful and consistent way, and keeping abreast of any necessary changes in scheduling or course requirements. 

	Tips for Becoming/Remaining an Active Contributor:

Bring all necessary course materials to class every day, especially the required readings.
Complete required assignments fully and on time. Be sure you updating your blog multiple times per week and checking in with our course blog regularly. 
Ask a question when you encounter material in the reading that you do not understand. (Someone else probably has the same question.)
Ask a question as soon as I have said something that you do not understand or request that I repeat myself.
Do not wait for me to call on you to raise your hand!

What does it mean to be enrolled in a “linked” course? The English 110 section is “linked” with Sociology 101 because the courses share some similar themes and, at times, you may see direct connections between discussions in both classes. You cannot drop one linked course without dropping the other.
The Writing Center: Located in Kiely Hall 229, tutors there are trained to help you revise your writing at various stages. If you believe you need additional help with your writing, or if I ask you to set up a regular meeting with a tutor, you should make an appointment at least one week prior to when an assignment is due. You can also get online help by visiting their website at http://qcpages.qc.edu/qcwsw/. 
Special Accommodations: If you have a learning, sensory, or physical reason for special accommodation in this class, contact the Office of Special Services in 171 Kiely Hall at 718-997-5870 and please inform me.
