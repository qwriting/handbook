# Incompletes, WU, and Grade Disputes

Students who fail English 110 can retake the course, and their new grade will override their first failing mark. (Any F received in the first semester at QC is automatically converted to NC – no credit.) 

INC (Incomplete) is not an automatic grade. It is a temporary grade that may be assigned by faculty when a student has requested an INC and meets all of the following conditions: some of the course requirements other than but possibly including the final examination have not been satisfied for good and sufficient reason as determined by the instructor; and there is a reasonable expectation that a student can pass the course by submitting the outstanding work by the end of the next regular semester, Spring or Fall. The assignment of INC constitutes an agreement with the student that the instructor or department will receive, evaluate, and submit a grade for the missing course requirements, upon submission of the outstanding work by the student. This requires the instructor to fill out a change of grade form before the end of the following semester, have it signed by the English department chair, and submit it to the Registrar’s office. Any agreement with a student for an INC should be in writing. Please consult with the directors of First Year Writing before agreeing to give a student an incomplete.

WU (Withdrawn Unofficially) is assigned by the instructor to indicate that the student stopped attending
the course before the end of the semester; or as a result of excessive absences there is no basis to give a final letter grade of A+ to F, and the conditions for a grade of INC do not apply.

If a student disputes a grade, contact the directors of First Year Writing, who will intervene and help resolve the issue.
