# The Syllabus

A clear and forceful explanation of your policies on the first day of class sets the level of expectations for the semester. On the first day of class, distribute a syllabus outlining your policies on attendance; late, missed, or uncompleted work; and plagiarism.  You may also wish to add what you expect students to call you and what your email policy is (if that is the best way for them to contact you, how often you will be checking it and what your general response time is, and the appropriate way for a student to address an email to a professor).

Talk through the syllabus in class, so students understand what you expect of them, and remind them to keep it handy.  Throughout the semester, direct students to the syllabus as necessary. 

In addition to making clear what you expect of your students, let them know what they may expect of you.  Make known your office hours, and keep them.  Arrive on time for class.  If you will be absent, try to arrange for a colleague to substitute for you and notify FYW and the English department office.

You will see a sample syllabus in the “Class Documents” section of the handbook.
