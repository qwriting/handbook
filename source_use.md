# Teaching Source Use

Discussion and practices related to source use should come up at several points during the semester.  Again, discussing the research practices of members of the university community helps students place themselves and their work within the context of academic inquiry and presentation.  Encourage students to think in terms of source use as they bring together arguments from assignments with their own ideas as they write throughout the semester. You should expect students to struggle with how to represent others' words and ideas even when you have covered it in class; therefore, plan activities that allow for hands-on practice and feedback.  Below are several examples of activities created by writing instructors that work along these lines. For another useful document on teaching source use, see the excerpt from Mark Gaipa’s “Breaking into the Conversation” on page 87 in Appendix III.
