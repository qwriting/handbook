# Common Grading Misconceptions

“The B Fallacy”

As you grade, be on the alert for the B fallacy: the temptation to overuse the B.  This grade does, after all, seem like a nice compromise: an essay is not A quality and a C is so...average.  To many teachers, new and experienced alike, a C seems like a condemnation. Why not a B?  If you think you are assigning too many B's and are vaguely dissatisfied with and confused by your practice, try to get back on track by asking yourself what elements in the essay deserve that grade. What, in short, makes this essay better than average?  Is it word choice?  organization?  expression of ideas?  If you can honestly point to a specific area in which the essay is better than most others you've seen, it may deserve the B.  If you can find no specific area in which the essay excels, you can be fairly certain it is indeed average. (The St. Martin's Guide to Teaching Writing 151)

One question sure to come up as you read the above is how to determine the definition of "average."  It may help to think of "average" as "competent"-- and competent starts with a C, which may make more sense anyway in terms of grade descriptors.

“First Set Fallacies”

Sometimes instructors think they should grade the first set of papers (or journals or response papers) differently than the rest.  Philosophies differ, but generally they fall into two categories: the "it's the first paper, so in order to not discourage them, they all get high grades" or the "it's the first paper, so to encourage them to work hard, I'll grade hard."  We encourage all instructors to grade all papers based on how well they meet the criteria set forth, not based on the time of the semester.  For every student who will be motivated by a low grade at the beginning of the semester is one who would be discouraged, and vice versa.  Better to let students negotiate their efforts in your class based on grades and comments which consistently and accurately reflect the writing they produce.
