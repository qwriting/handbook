# Student-Teacher Conferences

Student-teacher conferences are another effective method of collaborating with your students on their writing process and the products that evolve from it and English 110 is scheduled with a required conference hour every week.  (You can distribute these hours over the course of the semester in any way that makes sense with your calendar, allocating the time when your students need it most.)  Conferences in classes without the scheduled conference hour generally take one of two forms:

1. Two rounds of class-wide conferences during the semester in which you dismiss class and instead meet with each student for approximately 15-20 minutes (these conferences generally take place over a two- to three-day period).  
2. The conference initiated by the individual student.  In this situation, you need only respond to the studentâ€™s particular concern.  However, the same rules of conduct apply to all conferences.
