# Appendix IV: Handout on English 110 for Students

This handout is a useful resource for students who have questions about English 110 and placement in the course. 

### First Year Writing Program at Queens College

Writing is fundamental to a Queens College education and the first step is English 110: College Writing 1. With no more than 20 students, these intimate seminars are the single course that all Queens College freshmen experience. For this reason, the College Writing curriculum is designed to give students a basic understanding of the principles and methods of college writing that they will continue to practice and master in their other classes. In short, this class offers the foundation for future success in any student’s major field of study. Students can expect a lively, engaging, and interactive classroom with a smaller class size than usual. Students will be able to share ideas with peers, work with digital texts and environments, workshop pieces of writing, use and understand the library’s resources, participate in discussion-based classes, and help to build a community of learners in their first year.

Ultimately the purpose of English 110 is to facilitate the entry of students into the cross-curricular dialogue of the college. College Writing I will help students understand the recursive practices of reading, writing, thinking, and revision, which are central to the making and representation of knowledge. 

Your English 110 class will be in an FYI community, which means everyone in your class will also be enrolled in the same General Education class. The Freshman Year Initiative is a unique program that brings entering students together in two linked courses during their first semester at Queens College. Students in a College Writing course focused on “NYC” might also be linked to an Urban Studies course, or those choosing the topic “Evolution” would be in a linked Anthropology class. Students will experience courses that are intellectually stimulating introductions to the liberal arts and the work of college, as well as be encouraged to create a dynamic interplay between the course contents, methods, and disciplinary perspectives introduced in the linked courses.

### How does English 110 fit into the Queens College curriculum?

English 110 is one of two required composition courses. The second is College Writing 2, which will be offered in a variety of departments in the second semester. Students must fulfill both college writing requirements before they have taken 60 credits and preferably in their freshman year.  

### Can I be exempt from English 110?

Transfer students can be exempt from this course only if they have taken a similar course and worth the same (or greater) number of credits that has met the requirements of the guidelines and learning goals for English 110. Equivalent CUNY courses are listed on TIPPS. If you think you’ve taken a course that is equivalent at a non-CUNY institution, you should find out if the course is equivalent at your transfer credit evaluation. If the course is one that is not on the equivalency list, you can have the course evaluated through the First Year Writing program. Because English 110 is a class that prepares students for the rigorous writing demands of Queens College, the school does not award exemptions for AP exams, the CLEP exam, a college preparatory or bridge program that is not “College Now” through CUNY, or exemptions from other schools. 

### Is English your second or third language?n

Students who speak a first language other than English might find it helpful to enroll in English 95 before taking English 110. English 95 is a credit-bearing course specifically designed for those who want or need additional writing instruction in advance of English 110, which the student can then take in the following semester. You do not need to be an international student or have an official ESL designation to take this course. Those interested in signing up for English 95 can register in the CESL office in Kiely 227.

### What is College Writing 2? 

All Queens College students need to enroll in a College Writing 2 class after the successful completion of English 110: College Writing 1. College Writing 2 will be offered in departments and divisions across campus. Students will be encouraged to take their second writing course in the departments of their majors (or in departments whose methodologies are similar or complementary), so that they learn to gather and analyze evidence in ways that their discipline values most. Thus, students might choose from a variety of College Writing 2 titles such as: Writing about History, Writing about Biology, Writing in the Social Sciences, or Writing about Literature.  Along with English 110: College Writing 1, College Writing 2 will satisfy the CUNY English composition requirement. 

### What are W classes?

W classes are writing-intensive classes and are designated with a W at the end of the course number (e.g., ENGL 151W, SOC 210W). English 110: College Writing 1 is the college-wide prerequisite for W classes, although departments might have additional prerequisites for specific courses. We recommend students successfully complete their College Writing 2 course before enrolling in any W class. Queens College students must complete two W courses in order to graduate.
