# Special Accommodations

This is a debated area of the syllabus, which will surely continue to evolve as policy and awareness evolve.  Our understanding (per OSS) is that you cannot require students to share their disability status with you. Please DO NOT ask them to do so as part of your accommodations statement. 

The basic statement is below:

NOTE ABOUT SPECIAL ACCOMMODATION: If you have a learning, sensory, or physical need for special accommodation in this class, contact the Office of Special Services in 171 Kiely Hall at 718-997-5870. 

To consider:

- Many of us put this section of the syllabus at the end, simply because that’s how it’s always been done. Consider different places for the accessibility statement, and how they might reflect your values as an educator. n
- Consider a broader accessibility statement.  You MUST include the basic statement above someplace on your syllabus, but you can place it within the context of a broader statement if you choose to do so. 
- Consider a broader range of accessibility issues. Many students use their phones to access texts because they don’t have a personal computer. Many students live very far from campus, and will have difficulty accessing physical reserve materials. Think about issues of tech/resource accessibility when you make your class policies and accessibility statements. 


### Examples of other effective statements: 

NOTE ABOUT SPECIAL ACCOMMODATION: If you have a learning, sensory, or physical need for special accommodation in this class, contact the Office of Special Services in 171 Kiely Hall at 718-997-5870. If you feel comfortable informing me of your need for accommodation, please do so.  You are entitled to and deserve accommodations that will allow you to learn, so please never hesitate to reach out for help to me or to the Office of Special Services. We are here to give you the supports you need and deserve in order to learn.  

From Jennifer Polish’s (jpolish1@qc.cuny.edu) “Mobility in a Cultural Context”: 

If you have a learning, sensory, physical, or other reason for needing any kind of special  accommodation in this class, contact the Office of Special Services in 171 Kiely Hall at 718.997.5870, and please feel free to reach out to me for additional assistance.

This approach, from Hilarie Ashton’s (hashton@qc.cuny.edu) “Race and Gender in Celebrity Culture,” highlights Ashton’s pedagogical stance towards accessibility: 

UNIVERSAL LEARNING: In the spirit of Universal Design for Learning, I work towards an environment that is equitable and conducive to learning for all students. I also ask that we all use inclusive language in written and oral work. If you require accommodation in this class, please contact the Office of Special Services in Kiely Hall 171 or at (718) 997-5870. I encourage anyone with disabilities or particular needs that impact your work to meet with me to co-design accommodations. (hat tip to Cindy Lewiecki-Wilson)
