# Guidelines for English 110 

Writing Assignments foster a conversation about the course topic with:

- At least four formal essays over the course of the semester, for a total of at least 4,000 words. However, an annotated bibliography or some other writing-intensive project may be substituted for the fourth essay.
- At least one formal research essay or project that introduces students to using and evaluating library resources. Sources should include both physical and online materials, such as CUNY+, appropriate research databases like JSTOR or EBSCOHost, and Rosenthal Library. Additionally, all 110 courses should schedule at least one meeting with a librarian (see information about library session, page 79).
- Pre-draft writing, drafts, and revisions of all formal writing assignments. At least one of these revisions should be done as a peer review.
- Regular, ungraded informal pieces of writing (both in class and outside). 
-eading Assignments serve writing assignments, as they are selected with writing in mind and are examined from a rhetorical point of view. In addition, they should be limited to what may be discussed in class or on an electronic forum. Because of this, students in English 110 read to learn:
- Methods for active engagement with a variety of texts and genres of appropriate difficulty for college freshmen.
- Principles of excellent writing—for example, the development of a style appropriate to a particular audience, responsible use of evidence, and methods of analysis.
- The conventions of academic writing and other genres.
- How academic sources “speak” in “conversation,” and how to intervene among them with authority in writing.

Every student in English 110 conducts original research and enters into a scholarly community through:

- A process of inquiry that he or she devises through the analysis of evidence.
- A clearly defined policy on academic integrity that is stated on the course syllabus.
- The academic conventions of citation, which they practice by integrating source material into their writing (see section on Teaching Source Use, page 57).
- The distinctions they draw between primary and secondary sources.
- The regular use of “The Goals for Student Writing at Queens College” (http://writingatqueens.org/) and a vocabulary for discussing elements of writing, such as Gordon Harvey’s “Elements of Academic Writing” (page 92).
- When possible or appropriate, a digital platform that encourages formal and/or informal student writing. The digital platforms could include anything from blogs, wikis, podcasts, videos, Blackboard discussion threads, Epsilen software, social networking sites, or anything along those lines. For more information, see section on technology in the classroom, page 79.
