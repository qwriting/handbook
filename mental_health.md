# Students with Mental Health Issues

If you have a student who has some kind of behavioral problem that makes you worried, you should file a report with the Office of Student Affairs even if the student hasn't violated any policies or broken any rules. The College assembles a "behavioral intervention team"—that is, somebody from the counseling office, somebody from public safety, and people from a few other offices—to figure out how they can help students who are in trouble, or who might cause trouble for others.  The team meets every two weeks to discuss the reports that come in via submitted [here](http://sl.qc.cuny.edu/behavioral.php). 

Note that any member of the college community can file a Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) report, so you can pass this link on to your students if they express concerns to you about other students or faculty. Also note that these reports can't be anonymous, because the counselors and administrators at the BIT want to know who to contact if they have any questions about what happened.

Please consult the Directors of First Year Writing if you have an issue with a student that makes you concerned.
