# Ground Rules for the Assignments

Every assignment enables students to write a wide variety of theses.  Binarisms (pro/con; compare/contrast) and leading questions are eschewed.

Every assignment asks students to go beyond descriptive theses.  The imperative to write a thesis with a motive is clearly stated.   

Assignments are reducible to a single sentence.

Every assignment articulates the need for evidence and analysis.

In addition to the four formal essays, there should be other forms of writing your students should engage in during the semester. These can include:

Blogging, journals, or response papers.  These can be used for class preparation, essay and research preparation, or as an inducement to write every day (a journal is literally a "daily writing").  Blogs and journals seem to be most successful when students are given a question or prompt to respond to.  How you assess or grade them varies according to how you use it in class.  

In-class writing assignments.  Informal in-class writing makes students more comfortable with their own and their peers’ writing.  It also allows students to discover and engage with ideas for longer, more polished papers.  Even if you don’t grade these informal assignments, you can figure them into the students’ final grades under the rubric of “homework,” using a check/no check system.

Avoid using writing as a punishment; many students already tend to view writing as an onerous task, and that’s an attitude we’d like to change.
