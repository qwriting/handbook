# Calculating Grades

There are two basic ways to calculate grades: on a 100-point scale and a four-point scale.  Below is a brief description of how to do grades either way (all students’ grades will eventually be converted to a four-point scale for the purposes of determining grade-point averages, but you assign letter grades -- and pluses and minuses do carry different weights at this university.)

100-point scale

1. You can convert letter grades to a percentage using the following scale:

A+ 	97-100		B+	87-89		C+	77-79		D+	67-69
A	93-96		B	83-86		C	73-76		D	60-66
A-	90-92		B-	80-82		C-	70-72		F	 0-59



2. Convert homework/response papers/journal grades into a letter grade and then a number -- if you're using points, divide the number of points received into number of points possible; if you're using a check system, decide how that translates to grades: you may want a check plus to be an A, a check to be a B, a check minus to be a C, for example, or you may want it to be a more organic decision that accounts for improvement.

3. Convert participation/attendance grades into a letter grade and then a number, using the scale above.  

4. Use a calculator/spreadsheet/pencil to calculate grades, for example:

Paper one 			C+	at 10%		78 x .10 =    7.80
Paper two 			B   	at 15%		85 x .15 =  12.75
Paper three 			B  	at 15%		85 x .15 =  12.75
Research Project 		B-	at 25% 		82 x .25 =  20.50
Journal/Response Papers	C  	at 20%		75 x .20 =  15.00
Participation/Attendance	B  	at 15%	 	85 x .15 =  12.75 (add all)
							     
      81.55 = B-

Four-point Scale

1. You can convert letter grades to a number using the following scale:

A+	4.0 		B+	3.33 		C+	2.33		D+	1.33	 
A	4.0		B	3.0		C	2.0		D	1.0
A-	3.67 		B- 	2.67 		C-	1.67		D-	0.67
F	0 - .50

2. Convert homework/response papers/journal grades into a letter grade and then a number—if you're using points, divide the number of points received into number of points possible; if you're using a check system, decide how that translates to grades: you may want a check plus to be an A, a check to be a B, a check minus to be a C, for example, or you may want it to be a more organic decision that accounts for improvement.

3. Convert participation/attendance grades into a letter grade and then a number, using the scale above.  

4. Use a calculator/spreadsheet/pencil to calculate grades, for example:

Paper one 			C+	at 10%		2.33 x .10 = .23    
Paper two 			B   	at 15%		3.0   x .15 = .45
Paper three 			B  	at 15%		3.0   x .15 = .45
Research Project 		B-	at 25% 		2.67 x .25 = .67
Journal/Response Papers	C  	at 20%		2.0   x .20 = .40
Participation/Attendance	B  	at 15%	 	3.0   x .15 = .45 (add all)
							     
      	     2.64 = B-
