# Helpful Hints for Setting Dates for the Syllabus

- Keep a calendar handy and mark out all vacation days, first and last days of classes
- Schedule any major due dates for the semester: this may include first drafts and final drafts of each essay assignment as well as a plan for the stages of the research paper
- Schedule your conference dates (see page 41 for more explanation)
- Establish the units of study you want to cover. As we suggested above, it’s a good idea to identify the skills you want students to learn, and then identify readings or issues that will help you teach those skills.
- Allow for flexibility. You can advise students in the syllabus you distribute that your due dates are subject to change. As you begin course work of your own, try to coordinate assignment due dates, where possible, with your own obligations as a student. Don’t plan to grade a set of research papers the week before your own seminar paper is due. If possible, build in one or two “free dates” in your syllabus, so that you can adjust to the pace of a particular set of students.
- Feel free to ask students about their prior writing experiences to gauge the level of your classroom. The diagnostic essay that you will give on the first or second day of class (often a better choice since some students may change their schedules after that first day) can also serve as a space for students to discuss their prior experiences with writing and serve as another way for you to get to know them and their writing.
- Think about having major due dates before breaks to encourage students to attend class
- Refer to your colleagues’ syllabi to get a sense of a reasonable timeline, recalling that most of us tend to squeeze in too much in too little time.
