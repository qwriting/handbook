# Sample “Works Cited” Handout

This activity engages students in an entertaining, fast-paced, citation showdown.  Bring in 10 different items (book, journal article, email, interview, etc.) and have groups of students compete to create a works cited page that lists all 10 documents.  Don’t forget to do this yourself before class so you can quickly see which group is the winner.

### Writing Bibliographic Entries for a Works Cited Page

Exercise: Your goal, with the other members of your group, is to write correct and complete works cited entries for each of the ten items at the front of the room. The group to correctly complete the ten items first will win. (Remember, the fastest group doesn't necessarily win. The winning group is that with the fasted time and all the entries completed correctly.)

### Rules and Tips:

1. Your group may only possess one item at a time. If caught with more than one item, you will receive a penalty.
2. All the entries you wish to turn in must be written on one paper with all the group members' names on it. I will not accept entries written on separate sheets of paper.
3. You will need to refer to [the Purdue OWL](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/ and http://writingatqueens.org/for-students/what-is-plagiarism) for rules and guidelines on how to correctly write each entry. The entries must be written according to the MLA documentation standards. MLA format sources will serve as reference to you throughout your college career. Now is the time to learn to use them! 
4. Your group may only ask me two questions during the completion of the game. (And these questions cannot be if a certain entry is written correctly, though I can answer questions about specific elements of an entry.)
5. A works cited entry must be written in the space next to the number corresponding to the number physically attached to the item. There are ten items total.
6. Groups caught copying off of other groups will be immediately disqualified.
7. If I cannot read an entry, I will consider it incorrect. Please write legibly. 
8. Remember to indent the second and subsequent lines of each entry.
