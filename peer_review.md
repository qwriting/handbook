# Peer Review

Peer review (also called peer response, peer conferencing, writing groups, workshopping, peer editing, etc.) has a variety of purposes.  Using writing groups (or pairs) assists students with the revision process, exposes them to their peers’ writing, and teaches them to read carefully and write critically about the work of others. Some examples of the peer review process are in Appendix IV, page 98. 

Students may be unfamiliar with the concept of peer review and equally unsure of the process involved (“I don’t know anything about writing, so how can I help anyone else?” is a common question).  They may be reluctant to criticize the work of their peers and thereby have a tendency to write overly positive reviews.  They may also forego commenting on larger issues like organization and evidence, focusing only on grammar and mechanics—the elements of writing they see as having hard and fast “rules” for evaluation.  Modeling the peer review process with your students is often an effective way to show students how to provide thorough, thoughtful responses that balance compliments and constructive criticism.  

In addition to modeling the peer review process, you should establish specific guidelines for students to follow for each workshop session.  Encourage your students to focus on the elements of composition that you are working on at that particular time of the semester, such as argument, paragraph organization, thesis statements, source integration, and other larger issues.  

Since successful workshop formats vary widely, in preparing to present your peer review guidelines to your students, there are several aspects of the peer review process that you will want to consider:

Group size.  Do you want students to work in pairs or groups?  How large do you want groups to be? (Three to five people is generally the most manageable.)

Group arrangement. How do you intend to form writing groups (assigned or chosen by students)?  Do you want the groups to stay the same throughout the semester or to shift with each assignment?

Active participation.  You may want to clarify for your students what constitutes a “draft.”  Is there a page minimum that needs to be reached by the workshop day?  Are there specific elements of the essay that need to be completed in order for a successful and productive peer review to occur?

Feedback. What form do you want the students’ responses to take: a written letter to their peer, a worksheet, a discussion on an electronic discussion board, and/or oral feedback?  

Evaluation.  How is the peer review process factored in to students’ grades?  Will you collect worksheets/revision suggestions along with the final draft? (Acknowledging that work done in peer review sessions will be evaluated often sends the message that the activity is to be taken seriously.)

Timing.  At what point in the writing process will a workshop be most useful?  (For some assignments, such as the research project, it might be useful to have multiple workshop days.)  Should students exchange papers and read them prior to meeting?  Should they read them aloud to each other during class time?  Will the entire workshop process be completed during class or will there be preliminary and/or follow-up assignments for the activity?

Instructor’s Role.  Will you have read the rough drafts before the in-class workshop?  Do you intend to participate in the groups’ discussions?  How will you circulate throughout the room and/or monitor individual student participation?  You may wish to conduct conferences with each group as an addition to (or in place of) the in-class workshop.  Group conferences are often a good way to guide students through the workshop process. (See suggestions for successful conferencing below.)

There are, needless to say, a wide variety of ways to conduct the peer review process.  Moreover, instructors, assignments, and students are ever changing variables in the equation for producing a successful peer response.  Discovering the process that works best for you and your students may take a bit of experimentation, but the benefits of a well-planned, well-executed workshop are often evidenced in the final drafts.
