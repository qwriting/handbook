Many English 110 instructors no longer require students to purchase books and instead make readings available online through Blackboard or a course website. The English 110 topics site on Qwriting offers many hyperlinked readings for the topics-based courses, and instructors can post these readings to Blackboard or a class blog so students can access them electronically (note: the 110 topics site is for instructors only; do not give students access to that site. Post readings on your course Blackboard site or your course blog. In the case of a blog, make sure the site is not public and that only the students in your course have access). Additional readings you choose to assign may already be available in electronic format for you to download and post, or you can scan them from your own resources and post them. This allows you to pick and choose a list of readings that fulfills exactly what you envision for your students, without relying on textbooks that cover a broad base of standard readings that are not tailored to your course goals. The use of electronic sources also saves students money on textbooks. You should clearly define for students on the first day your policy on bringing the readings to class. Will you allow them to use a laptop or an electronic device in class? Will you require them to print them and bring hardcopies to class? 

If you would like to make a paper reader for class, you can use Reprographics on campus or the copy store next to Ginoâ€™s on Kissena.
