# Sample Quotation Handout1

[The following handout discusses how quotations can be used in academic prose to further argumentation.  It can help students to see the inclusion of quotations as increasing their credibility as writers, rather than making it look like their argument isn’t their own.]

### Using Quotations and Making Arguments

Although Jojo Binks posits that "students love[d] to dance around the quad naked on a regular basis" (33), university documents provide no evidence of any such behavior; in fact, the official online university charter describes students on campus as having always been "uniformly well-behaved and focused on scholastics" (Queens College). The stark difference in these two accounts of student behavior points to the probability that neither account is completely accurate. It is as unlikely that many students actually danced around the quad naked at all, much less on a regular basis, as it is that students here have always been "uniformly well-behaved." The reality is probably somewhere in between these two arguments, but for the people writing the documents, this may be both the truth as they see it and the image of university life they'd like their audience to believe.

The example above demonstrates one way (among many possible ways) to:

(a) incorporate quotations into the writer's own sentence  
(b) have sources converse with one another  
(c) start to analyze deeply based on short quotations  
(d) pay close attention to the wording of the quotations themselves as sites to converse with the sources and contend with their accuracy (note the focus on "a regular basis" and "uniformly well-behaved")  
(e) start to analyze why a person might write something based on their intended/expected audience  
(f) change the tense of a quotation so it fits within the writer's sentence (note the "[d]" added to "love"—you can add words or changed tenses using brackets to make your sentence work with the quotation.)  

Think of a different, brief, way of using these same pieces of evidence (you may quote or paraphrase) to make some argument. You could use a similar argument as the one above, but construct it in a different way or you could argue something completely different. Here's the citation and other information you have to work with (it's all completely fake):

Binks, Jojo. Personal Letter to Amanda Garcia. Scrapbook. 1937. 33-35.

"My favorite thing about going to school here is that students love to dance around the quad naked on a regular basis."

"Queens College Official Charter." 5 Oct. 2001. 12 Nov. 2002 <http://www.qc.cuny.edu/ officialcharter/i made this up/gotcha>.1

"Students at Queens College have, since the college's inception, been uniformly well-behaved and focused on scholastics more than on any forms of extracurricular activities."
