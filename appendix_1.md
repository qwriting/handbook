#  Appendix I: Computing on the Campus

### The QC Network

Information from all over campus is networked through the Queens College web site, (www.qc.cuny.edu/).  Thanks to this network, instructors are able to communicate with and glean information from other departments around campus and, through the internet, the world at large.  Furthermore, we advantage our students by asking them to utilize these networks in our classes; by teaching them how to find and access reliable sources of information through this increasingly important technology.  Below is the information you need to set up your Queens College accounts as well as a sampling of the computer resources available at the college and a brief description of how these resources can be utilized. 

### CAMS, Email, and ID Cards

CAMS is the College Account Management System. You’ll need to set up a CAMS account in order to be able to access blackboard, access the on-campus wireless, receive a QC email address, and reserve media and computer labs. 

To get a CAMS account follow these steps:

1. Ask the English department main office personnel for a letter verifying that you are teaching at QC for the fall semester. You will need to give her your social security number for this letter.
2. Fill out the Office of Converging Technologies Computer Access Form, which the English department will give you.
3. Take the letter and form to the OCT Help Desk, located in the building that connects the cafeteria and iBuilding. They will help you set up the account. 

Once you have a CAMS account you will be able to get a QC ID card, called a QCard. After activating your CAMS account, you can get your QCard on the next business day that the QCard Office is open. QCards are issued in the QCard Office, located in the Dining Hall, Room 116C, next to QTips and the QSide Lounge. You must bring two photo IDs as proof of identification (e.g., your old college ID, a driver’s license, a state-issued non-driver ID, or a passport). 

Below is the Office of Converging Technology’s procedure and for obtaining a CAMS account. This is helpful to have, should you experience any difficulty after receiving your verification letter from the English department.

How to Activate your CAMS (Email) and Active Directory Account

Every student, staff, and faculty member needs a CAMS account. CAMS Accounts are connected to emails and personal accounts.

Step 1 – To get onto CAMS, go to https://cams.qc.cuny.edu/.
Click on the yellow Sign Up Now button to begin creating your CAMS account.

Step 2 – After you click on the yellow button, a pink screen comes up asking for your information. The information needed to create a CAMS account is the:

Step 10 – Click on the Logout button to complete the process. Note: CAMS Accounts take 24-48 hours to fully activate.

### A Note on QC Email and Privacy

You should always use your Queens College email when interacting with students. You should avoid supplying personal information, such as your own email account address, to students. And in the very rare event that you have a problem with a student, any email correspondence that did not take place via the Queens College system cannot be used as evidence. 

Email should reflect careful, professional, and courteous writing, especially because it can easily be forwarded to others. Never assume that no one other than the addressee will read your email. Be careful about attachments and broad publication of messages. Copyright laws and license agreements do apply to email. 

A user can expect files and data that he or she generates to be private information, unless he or she takes action to reveal it to others. Should a legitimate College need exist, however, a duly authorized College official may monitor a users' keystrokes or may access a user’s files or data. A non-exclusive list of examples of appropriate reasons for such action includes the following:

Repair or maintenance of computing equipment as the College may deem necessary, including the testing of systems in order to ensure that appropriate levels of function, bandwidth, performance, and storage are being provided; 
Investigation of improper or illegal use of College I.T. resources; 
Response to an appropriate public records request, to an administrative or judicial order, or to a request for discovery in the course of litigation, or to any other action required by law.

Although the College has no interest in invading any user’s privacy, users should be aware that no computer system is entirely secure. Unauthorized individuals, working inside or outside of the College’s system, may find ways to access files despite the College’s best efforts to enforce security. Therefore, all users should be aware that the College cannot and does not provide any guarantee of user privacy.

### CUNYFirst

You will need CUNYFirst to access the most essential documents for your classes—your class rosters, attendance verifications, etc.  The acronym stands for Fully Integrated Resources and Services Tool, and it is a system that the college uses to keep track of all kinds of data.  To use it, you need an account.  If you didn’t submit paperwork for CUNYFirst when you were hired, see Kim Smith right away to get it.

After your account is established, you can access CUNYFirst [here](http://www.qc.cuny.edu/CUNYfirst/Faculty/Pages/default.aspx). All course materials can be accessed through the “Faculty Center.” To reach the “Faculty Center” after logging in, click “HR/Campus Solutions,” then “Self Service” (both in the right column). “Faculty Center” should be in the lower right corner.  

### Blackboard

The Office of Educational Technology manages the Blackboard Course Management System. Blackboard is a system which allows you to put your course materials on a web page and allows access to these materials only to the students registered in your course. Blackboard will allow you to email all of your students at once, establish discussion threads where you and your students can continuously post email on a particular subject, or even have real-time discussion with students. Blackboard allows you to put practice exams on line, to monitor the scores students receive on these exams, limit the number of times an exam may be taken, and to put the students' grades on line, as well. You can also establish groups within your course and allow each to have its own private space to share email and files.  For more information, go to http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/edtech/blackboard/

### MyQC

MyQC, Queens College’s Intranet, allows all the members of our community—faculty, staff, and students—to share information more easily with one another. Many resources not available on the main QC website are available here. MyQC is activated through your CAMS account. 

### Using Technology in Your Classroom

The First Year Writing program at Queens College is committed to discovering new ways to facilitate classroom learning with technology.  While we work within CUNY’s budgetary constraints and we also recognize the ways that educational technologies can work to enrich the corporations that sell them, we also encourage our instructors to find new ways to use digital technologies for pedagogical good.

### Qwriting.org

Queens College’s blogging and wiki platform, [Qwriting](http://qwriting.org/) hosts Wordpress software and MediaWiki and is available for faculty and student use. Many instructors set up a course blog through the QC Wordpress platform. For help with Qwriting, visit its [help page](http://help.qwriting.org/).

### Checking Out Media Equipment

- Projectors: If you want a projector for your class, you can check one out from the English department main office. We have four projectors and two laptops (PCs) available. Please take care of this equipment; if something happens, we do not have the means to get replacements. 
- Speakers: The English department has a speaker system that can be used with a projector and laptop to show video in class. It is in a canvas bag in the same drawer as the projectors. Ask the office staff to help you locate and sign out this equipment.
- Laptop cart: The English department has a laptop cart with 25 laptops in it that can be used for classes taught in Klapper. If you are interested in using it, ask Amy Wan. 
- Media Services: You can order projectors, DVD players/TVs, and screens (especially helpful if you teach in a classroom with no screen...they deliver!) through media services. The request form is [here](https://myqc.qc.cuny.edu/Pages/MediaServicesRequest.aspx/).

### Reserving Computer Classroom Spaces

Computer labs: If you are interested in being in a computer lab a few times during the semester, you can reserve a computer classroom through OCT. You can reserve a room at the [Computer Lab Request" link at MyQC](https://myqc.qc.cuny.edu/Pages/ComputerLabRequest.aspx/).
