# Observations

The union contract requires an evaluation of non-tenured members of the faculty, based in part on a classroom observation each semester.  Observations are intended to support the development of new faculty members; they are not a test.  They provide opportunities for junior faculty to benefit from our colleagues’ teaching experience.

Sometime in the first weeks of classes, your observer should contact you to arrange a time to visit your class.  He or she will sit in the class on that day and write an observation report that is submitted to the department within one week of the class observation.  Within two weeks after the observation, a post-observation conference between you and the observer must occur.  The presence of a third party at the post-observation conference is not required unless either the observer or the observee requests it.

If the attendance of a third part is not required, the observer should submit to the department a memorandum summarizing the post-observation conference.  If a third part observer is requested by either the observer or the observee, the Directors of First Year Writing will make this appointment.  He or she will then arrange for the post-observation conference and submit to the department a summary of the meeting.
	
Before the post-observation conference you will receive a copy of the observer's report. The observer's report must include the term "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory" to indicate the overall judgment of your evaluation.  Shortly after the conference, you will receive a copy of the memoran­dum summarizing the meeting.  You are requested to sign these documents and immediately return them to the English department main office personnel; however, your signature on either of these documents only indicate that you have read the reports not that you agree with their contents.  Should you choose the respond to the report; you are free to add comments of your own.
	
Your assigned observer will attend one class meeting of one of your assigned courses. While it is the observer’s responsibility to contact you, the course, day and time of the observation are at your discretion given the constraints of your and your observer’s teaching schedules.  The department has requested your assigned observer to contact you, not only to arrange a convenient date to attend a class, but also to have some preliminary discussion with you about your general purposes in the course, the context of the particular class to be observed, and the specific objectives of that class.  You must submit your syllabus and any relevant additional course materials to your assigned observer immediately.

Here is a sample of the form that your observer will fill out.
