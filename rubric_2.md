Grading Standards

When I evaluate your formal assignments, I am looking for inventive ideas expressed in engaging prose. Your writing should both please and enlighten readers and give them a sense of why your project is important—why what you have to say needs to be said. I evaluate the words on the page before me and do not factor in potential, improvement, or effort. The work you put into an assignment will most certainly be evident in the completed essay. These are the general standards to which I hold essays. Plusses and minuses represent shades of difference. (I will provide more detailed explanation of my grading standards when I return graded assignments.)

- An “A” range essay is both ambitious and successful. It presents and develops focused and compelling set of ideas with grace, confidence, and control. It integrates and responds to sources subtly and persuasively.
- A “B” range essay is one that is ambitious but only partially successful, or one that achieves modest aims well. A “B” essay must contain focused ideas, but these ideas may not be particularly complex, or may not be presented or supported well at every point. It integrates sources efficiently, if not always gracefully.   
- A “C” range essay has significant problems in articulating and presenting its central ideas, though it is usually focused and coherent. Such essays often lack clarity and use source material in simple ways, without significant analysis or insight.
- A “D” range essay fails to grapple seriously with either ideas or texts, or fails to address the expectations of the assignment. A “D” essay distinguishes itself from a failing essay by showing moments of promise, such as emerging, though not sufficiently developed or articulated ideas. “D” essays do not use sources well, though there may some effort to do so.
- A failing essay does not grapple with either ideas or texts, or does not address the expectations of the assignment. It is often unfocused or incoherent.
