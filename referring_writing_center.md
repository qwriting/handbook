# Referring Students to the Writing Center

Kiely Hall 229; (718) 997-5676

The Writing Center’s mission is to help students grow and mature as writers by helping them build on their strengths and overcome whatever difficulties they may have with writing. Their goal is to make better writers, not better essays. Specific essays will improve, but only because their writers are sharpening their abilities. 

In other words, the Writing Center is not an essay repair shop. Tutors will not edit or proofread essays; instead, they will help writers learn how to do these things for themselves. Nor will tutors tell writers what to write, what to think, or give them ideas. In this way, as much as possible, they work with students in a nondirective fashion through individual sessions in which writers work one-on-one with undergraduate or graduate writing tutor. 

All writers have problems; even accomplished writers may experience difficulties with writing when they try to write about complex and unfamiliar subjects, when they attempt new writing tasks, when conditions undermine their ability to write, or when problems distract them. At such times, they will seek out feedback from other writers. Student writers face similar obstacles, and they deserve (and get) our attention and respect when they attempt to address them.

The help they provide seeks to promote independence. The advice they give in tutorial sessions is professional and, as already stated, nondirective. The tutoring sessions belong to the students, and that is why students have access to the records the writing center keeps of their work and why they do not notify teachers of their students’ visits if students ask us not to.

To assist QC students with their writing, the Writing Center offers a number of different services:

A. In-Person Appointments:

Students needing help with their writing can get a one-hour drop-in appointment or be assigned a weekly one-hour appointment during these hours:

Monday – Thursday: 10:00am – 2:00pm & 3:00-8:00pm 

Friday: 10:00am – 1:00pm

Saturday: 10:00am – 2:00pm 

The aspects of writing to be covered will be decided by the student and the tutor or by instructor recommendation. This personalized work aims to correct specific writing problems and reinforce writing strengths. The initial appointment will be for four consecutive weeks; it can be extended beyond that period if the tutor recommends it and the student attends each session. If a student misses the first appointment, he/she will lose it. 

B. “Dropping-In”:

A student who needs help with writing can get a “Drop-In” appointment by reserving one of the drop-in hours we now have scheduled each day or by coming to the Writing Center at the beginning of each hour during our hours of operation. 

C. Online Tutoring:

A student can get feedback on essays via the internet. For more information, go to http://writingatqueens.org/the-writing-center/

Please be sensitive about when and how you refer students to the writing center; while not a punishment or a sign of remediation, a recommendation for a writing center visit might be perceived as such.
