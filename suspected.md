# Dealing with Suspected Plagiarism

See the [section on CUNY’s plagiarism policy](official_integrity.md), as well as the [Queens College Academic Integrity Violation Form](appendix_3.md).  Note that the English Department takes plagiarism very seriously, and we see it as part of the job of English 110 to teach students how to use proper methods of citation. The Directors of First Year Writing advise you to follow the college’s policy on plagiarism, and to see us if you have questions about how to implement it.
