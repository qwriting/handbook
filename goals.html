                                <h1 id="goals-of-english-110college-writing-1">Goals of English 110/College Writing 1</h1><p>Although each of us has different expectations of our students, collectively we share some common goals for our writing courses.  All of these goals are based on the philosophy that within an environment of process-centered learning and collaboration, the mission of the teacher is to help students become successful academic writers.</p><h3 id="course-philosophy">Course philosophy</h3><p>The primary goal of English 110 is to introduce students to the writing strategies and methods of inquiry that are at the heart of a liberal arts education and the College&#x2019;s General Education curriculum. To foster this kind of authority, English 110 puts writing at its center. In other words, it sequences assignments and class activities to teach the craft, rhetoric, and processes of writing. Students pursue questions of scholarly consequence as they build the authority they need to write their way into existing intellectual conversations. We recognize that college-level writing looks very different and functions very differently across disciplinary boundaries, but we hope to help our students meet those wide-ranging challenges with aplomb.</p><p>To achieve that goal, we organize our syllabi around interdisciplinary topics, rendering English 110 not an &#x201C;English&#x201D; class in the conventional sense.  We aim to place no particular emphasis on literary study, because we take seriously our obligation to teach our students how scholars across the curriculum gather and analyze evidence in writing.</p><p>We know that one semester is woefully insufficient to meet this goal.   A recent high school graduate will not instantly write with the authority of a professional in any field&#x2014;much less every field&#x2014;but we hope to set her on that path with solid footing by articulating for her the expectations of the scholarly community we share.</p><h3 id="expectations-for-the-course-include">Expectations for the course include...</h3><h4 id="preparing-students-for-college-writing-expectations">...preparing students for college writing expectations.</h4><p>Our program focuses primarily on the conventions of academic writing, because we embrace our obligation to prepare first-year students to succeed in their General Education courses and their majors.  We focus on academic analysis and argumentation, and on critical thinking and reading, and aim to help our students build the interdisciplinary foundations that they need to write well in any context they choose.  Most immediately, we prepare students to succeed in College Writing 2, which they will take after English 110 in a discipline of their choice.</p><h4 id="introducing-students-to-expository-strategies">...introducing students to expository strategies.</h4><p>Because First Year Writing is designed as a first step to critical thinking, we teach students the rhetorical skills they need to analyze scholarly evidence, and to evaluate their analyses in the context of others&#x2019;.  Students learn a variety of strategies that help them to probe texts and definitions, compare summaries, evaluate perspectives, and sustain an argument.  Their ability to comprehend and use the knowledge and views of others to construct knowledge and write informed arguments of their own will largely determine their success in the course.  To some considerable extent, then, you will be teaching your students to read as well as to write on a college level.</p><h4 id="teaching-the-importance-of-revision">...teaching the importance of revision.</h4><p>As we teach our students to revise their drafts into polished essays, we aim to help them strengthen their writing processes. Focusing on process as well as product, we explore how, given a writing task, writers decide on an angle of attack; how they research, organize, and narrow their field of inquiry; how they arrange, compose, revise, and edit their language; and how they determine when to stop.</p><p>In truth, no piece of writing is ever really finished.  Even professional writers know that what has gone to press could have been better.  As they learn and internalize viable revision processes, students can evaluate and even question feedback from their peers and their instructor.  They can discover what awkward and vague really mean, and do something to remedy imprecise communications.  They can monitor what is getting through to their audience and what is not, and they can pressure their editors to be more exact as well.  Putting a work through several drafts gives students the sense of how an essay grows and changes, and the facility they gain from rewriting should help as well on those occasions when they are writing against the clock, with no time for revision.</p><h4 id="developing-students-rhetorical-skills-and-knowledge">...developing students&#x2019; rhetorical skills and knowledge.</h4><p>To help our students become more conscious of the choices they make as writers, we discuss with them the purpose of every assignment, and we note the ways that purposes shape both the form and the content of writing.  Since first year writing courses emphasize academic writing, we focus on helping students respond to the exigencies and conventions of academic discourse.  We teach students to respond to various audiences and rhetorical situations of the academy by adopting the appropriate styles and genres for those contexts.</p><h4 id="helping-students-to-learn-from-one-another">...helping students to learn from one another.</h4><p>As students read and respond to their peers&#x2019; papers, whether finished or in-progress, they develop a writing vocabulary and learn revision strategies they can apply to their own work.  Student texts can be as valuable a learning tool as professional writing, and we encourage you to use examples of student writing in the classroom.  We also suggest that you arrange for students to work collaboratively on some of their projects, since teamwork is productive for many students, and we aim to strengthen the community of writers at Queens College.</p><p>For more information, see the goals and guidelines for English 110.</p><h3 id="what-english-110-is-not">What English 110 Is Not</h3><p>Many instructors who teach English 110 never took a first-year course in college writing.  They may have placed out with AP credit, or taken a literature-based composition course instead.  For those of you who have no model to draw on in designing a writing course, or who have taught an introductory writing course with different aims elsewhere, here are a few observations about what first year writing at Queens College is not:</p><p>ENGL 110 is not a grammar course.  You will be expected, of course, to help your students with grammatical problems.  You will be a resource for their grammatical questions, and offer explanations as needed.  But you won&#x2019;t be spending regular class time diagramming sentences or giving quizzes on verb tenses, or failing papers for excessive comma splices.</p><p>ENGL 110 is not a course in personal writing (&#x201C;How I spent my summer vacation&#x201D;), nor is it a &#x201C;modes&#x201D; course, wherein students spend two weeks on argument, two weeks on description, and two more on comparison and contrast.  It&#x2019;s also not a course in which we imitate the stylistic devices of others.  Our courses teach students to write well in college in part by helping them comprehend and respond to the words and ideas of others.</p><p>ENGL 110 is not a literature or film course, nor is it a course in creative writing.  Instead, our mission is to help students learn to write academic prose suitable for course work at Queens College.</p><p>Finally, ENGL 110 is not a weed-out course.  It is designed to help students succeed in college, not to identify underprepared students and fail them.</p>
