# Appendix III: Useful Queens College Information

### ID Cards, Offices, Mailboxes

You will need a QC ID card (a QCard) for accessing the library. After obtaining a CAMS account (see page 74) you can go the QCard Office (Dining Hall, room 116C) and they will issue you an ID card. 

The English department will assign you an office that you will share with one or two other adjuncts. You will need to schedule a minimum of one hour per week in the office (see page 43) so students have a time and place where they can arrange to meet with you outside of class hours. You will need to go to Security (Jefferson Hall 201) to pick up the key to your office.

The English department adjunct office on the 6th floor of Klapper Hall has computer and printers available to you for your printing needs. Photocopying in the English office (Klapper 607) is available, but the two copiers are shared by the entire department and should therefore be limited to smaller jobs. You will need a code to access these copiers; ask the English department main office personnel for a user name and password. 

A mailbox will be assigned to you in the English department office, Klapper 607. It is important that you check your mailbox regularly, as this is where the department will distribute important information, where you can have sample textbooks from publishers sent, etc.
