# Grading

Assigning grades to papers is likely one of the most anxiety-producing tasks any teacher faces.  The important thing to remember is to clearly connect your grading criteria with what you taught your students; prepare your students for what you're looking for.  If precise placement of a thesis statement is very important to you, share that with your students; if a dangling modifier is going to cause you heart palpitations, show students how to avoid that and incorporate it into your criteria explicitly.

In this section of the handbook, we'll offer you three sample rubrics.  These rubrics are aligned with general departmental expectations for student writing, but no rubric will precisely fit with your teaching style and the skills you want to emphasize in your class.  We encourage you to use these sample rubrics as a starting point and to develop them further both on your own and with your students.  Students are far more likely to understand their grades and to respect your authority in grading if they're given the opportunity to have input on what the evaluation criteria will be.  Many students are surprisingly savvy at determining solid criteria for a given writing task.
