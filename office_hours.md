# Office Hours

Instructors are required to hold one office hour per week.  Be sure to announce your office hours to your students often and to be there during those scheduled times.  Let your students know that they can make appointments for discussion of their work-in-progress.  While students are certainly permitted to arrive “unannounced” to your office hours, you might encourage them to provide you with information about topics they would like to discuss prior to their office visit, if possible.  This will allow you to prepare for the meeting and to provide them with the best possible assistance.
