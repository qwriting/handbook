# Handouts

The Gordon Harvey handout is useful in acclimating students to the academic language we use in assessing writing. The Mark Gaipa handout is a great resource for teaching students the ways to use their research to enter an academic conversation. The peer review and conferencing section offers some suggestions on how to handle these sessions and provides sample handouts to help you direct students in responding to each other’s work.

Gordon Harvey's "Elements of the Academic Essay" 

1. Thesis: your main insight or idea about a text or topic, and the main proposition that your essay demonstrates. It should be true but arguable (not obviously or patently true, but one alternative among several), be limited enough in scope to be argued in a short composition and with available evidence, and get to the heart of the text or topic being analyzed (not be peripheral). It should be stated early in some form and at some point recast sharply (not just be implied), and it should govern the whole essay (not disappear in places).

2. Motive: the intellectual context that you establish for your topic and thesis at the start of your essay, in order to suggest why someone, besides your instructor, might want to read an essay on this topic or need to hear your particular thesis argued--why your thesis isn't just obvious to all, why other people might hold other theses (that you think are wrong). Your motive should be aimed at your audience: it won't necessarily be the reason you first got interested in the topic (which could be private and idiosyncratic, meaning unique or particular to an individual) or the personal motivation behind your engagement with the topic. Indeed it's where you suggest that your argument isn't idiosyncratic, but rather is generally interesting. The motive you set up should be genuine: a misapprehension or puzzle that an intelligent reader (not a straw dummy, meaning a made-up version of an opponent's argument that can easily be defeated) would really have, a point that such a reader would really overlook. Defining motive should be the main business of your introductory paragraphs, where it is usually introduced by a form of the complicating word "But."

3. Evidence: the data--facts, examples, or details--that you refer to, quote, or summarize to support your thesis. There needs to be enough evidence to be persuasive; it needs to be the right kind of evidence to support the thesis (with no obvious pieces of evidence overlooked); it needs to be sufficiently concrete for the reader to trust it (e.g. in textual analysis, it often helps to find one or two key or representative passages to quote and focus on); and if summarized, it needs to be summarized accurately and fairly.

4. Analysis: the work of breaking down, interpreting, and commenting upon the data, of saying what can be inferred from the data such that it supports a thesis (is evidence for something). Analysis is what you do with data when you go beyond observing or summarizing it: you show how its parts contribute to a whole or how causes contribute to an effect; you draw out the significance or implication not apparent to a superficial view. Analysis is what makes the writer feel present, as a reasoning individual; so your essay should do more analyzing than summarizing or quoting.

5. Keyterms: the recurring terms or basic oppositions that an argument rests upon, usually literal but sometimes a ruling metaphor. These terms usually imply certain assumptions--unstated beliefs about life, history, literature, reasoning, etc. that the essayist doesn't argue for but simply assumes to be true. An essay's keyterms should be clear in their meaning and appear throughout (not be abandoned halfway); they should be appropriate for the subject at hand (not unfair or too simple--a false or constraining opposition); and they should not be inert clichés or abstractions (e.g. "the evils of society"). The attendant assumptions should bear logical inspection, and if arguable they should be explicitly acknowledged.

6. Structure: the sequence of main sections or sub-topics, and the turning points between them. The sections should follow a logical order, and the links in that order should be apparent to the reader (see "stitching"). But it should also be a progressive order--there should be a direction or development or complication, not simply a list or a series of restatements of the thesis ("Macbeth is ambitious: he's ambitious here; and he's ambitious here; and he's ambitious here, too; thus, Macbeth is ambitious").  And the order should be supple enough to allow the writer to explore the topic, not just hammer home a thesis. (If the essay is complex or long, its structure may be briefly announced or hinted at after the thesis, in a road-map or plan sentence.)

7. Stitching: words that tie together the parts of an argument, most commonly 1) by using transition (linking or turning) words as signposts to indicate how a new section, paragraph, or sentence follows from the one immediately previous; but also 2) by recollection of an earlier idea or part of the essay, referring back to it either by explicit statement or by echoing key words or resonant phrases quoted or stated earlier. The repeating of key or thesis concepts is especially helpful at points of transition from one section to another, to show how the new section fits in.

8. Sources: persons or documents, referred to, summarized, or quoted, that help a writer demonstrate the truth of his or her argument. They are typically sources of 1) factual information or data, 2) opinions or interpretation on your topic, 3) comparable versions of the thing you are discussing, or 4) applicable general concepts. Your sources need to be efficiently integrated and fairly acknowledged by citation.

9. Reflecting: when you pause in your demonstration to reflect on it, to raise or answer a question about it--as when you 1) consider a counterargument--a possible objection, alternative, or problem that a skeptical or resistant reader might raise; 2) define your terms or assumptions (what do I mean by this term? or, what am I assuming here?); 3) handle a newly emergent concern (but if this is so, then how can X be?); 4) draw out an implication (so what? what might be the wider significance of the argument I have made? what might it lead to if I'm right? or, what does my argument about a single aspect of this suggest about the whole thing? or about the way people live and think?), and 5) consider a possible explanation for the phenomenon that has been demonstrated (why might this be so? what might cause or have caused it?); 6) offer a qualification or limitation to the case you have made (what you're not saying). The first of these reflections can come anywhere in an essay; the second usually comes early; the last four often come late (they're common moves of conclusion).

10. Orienting: bits of information, explanation, and summary that orient the reader who isn't expert in the subject, enabling such a reader to follow the argument. The orienting question is, what does my reader need here? The answer can take many forms: necessary information about the text, author, or event (e.g. given in your introduction); a summary of a text or passage about to be analyzed; pieces of information given along the way about passages, people, or events mentioned (including announcing or "set-up" phrases for quotations and sources). The trick is to orient briefly and gracefully.

11. Stance: the implied relationship of you, the writer, to your readers and subject: how and where you implicitly position yourself as an analyst. Stance is defined by such features as style and tone (e.g. familiar or formal); the presence or absence of specialized language and knowledge; the amount of time spent orienting a general, non-expert reader; the use of scholarly conventions of form and style. Your stance should be established within the first few paragraphs of your essay, and it should remain consistent.

12. Style: the choices you make of words and sentence structure. Your style should be exact and clear (should bring out the main idea and action of each sentence, not bury it) and plain without being flat (should be graceful and a little interesting, not stuffy).

13. Title: It should both interest and inform. To inform (i.e., inform a general reader who might be browsing in an essay collection or bibliography) your title should give the subject and focus of the essay. To interest, your title might include a linguistic twist, paradox, sound pattern, or striking phrase taken from one of your sources (the aptness of which phrase the reader comes gradually to see). You can combine the interesting and informing functions in a single title or split them into title and subtitle. The interesting element shouldn't be too cute; the informing element shouldn't go so far as to state a thesis. Don't underline your title, except where it contains the title of another text.

8 Strategies for Critically Engaging Secondary Sources

The strategies below are adapted, and the figures reproduced, from Mark Gaipa’s “Breaking into the Conversation:  How Students Can Acquire Authority in Their Writing,” Pedagogy 4.3 (2004):  419-37.  Note that these strategies may be used globally, as a way of framing an argument, or locally, as a way of engaging sources at a particular stage in an argument.  

Strategy 1:  Picking a Fight – Knock down a scholar’s argument and, in the best version of this strategy, replace it with one’s own.

Strategy 2:  Ass Kissing, or Riding a Scholar’s Coattails – Agree with a scholar to gain evidence and authority.  Possibly go on to defend the scholar from attack by another scholar, thus resolving a larger controversy.

Strategy 3:  Piggybacking, or Standing on the Shoulders of a Giant – Agree with a scholar (i.e., kiss ass), but then complete or extend the scholar’s work, usually by borrowing an idea or concept from the scholar and developing it through application to a new subject or new part of the conversation.

Strategy 4:  Leapfrogging, or Biting the Hand That Feeds You – Agree with a scholar (i.e., kiss ass), then identify and solve a problem in the scholar’s work—for example, an oversight, inconsistency, or contradiction.

Strategy 5:  Playing Peacemaker – Identify a conflict or dispute between two or more scholars, then resolve it using a new or more encompassing perspective.

Strategy 6:  Taking on the Establishment, or Acting Paranoid – Pick a fight with everyone in a critical conversation—for example, by showing how the status quo is wrong, a critical consensus is actually unfounded, or a dispute is based on a faulty assumption.

Strategy 7:  Dropping Out, or Finding Room on the Margins – Focus on an issue in the margins of the critical conversation, illuminating that issue and (in the best version of this strategy) ultimately redefining the conversation itself.

Strategy 8:  Crossbreeding with Something New – Inject really new material into the critical conversation to produce a new argument.  For example, bring in a theory from another discipline to reinterpret the evidence, bring in new evidence to upset an old theory or interpretation, or establish an original framework (a combination of theories, a historical understanding) to 
reinterpret the evidence.

### Peer Review Handouts

<pre>
Making Peer Conference Work for You


Group Members: ___________________________________________________________________

Day, date, time, and place of conference: __________________________________________________

Before the conference session:
1. Review your own essay.  Your peers have put a lot of effort into making your essay better.  Demonstrate that you have done the same.

2. If for some reason you make major revisions to your essay after you submit your working draft, but before the conference, please make every effort to let your readers know as soon as possible.  Send them a revised draft, or contact them and tell them not to bother with whatever aspect of the essay you’ve decided to change.  Nothing is more frustrating for a reader than investing valuable time on something the writer won’t even use.

3. Bring a copy of your draft with you to the conference so that you can follow along.

During the conference session:
4. In this space, summarize what each respondent says.  Record each person’s name so that if you realize later that you didn’t understand what was said you’ll know who to contact.

5. After listening to the respondents, take a few seconds to absorb what has been said.  If you need clarification, ask for it.  If the group has not yet made suggestions, ask them now what you can do to improve your essay.

After the conference session:
6. Carefully read the written comments of your peer reviewers and the instructor, and review your notes from the peer conference.

7. Now that you have a better sense of what is working in your essay and what still needs improvement, you need to develop a plan for revision.  You will need to use your feedback selectively.

Comments about the Conceptual Approach and the Thesis, for example, may suggest that you need to make large-scale revisions.  Think carefully about the best solution before you strategize your revisions: do you need to re-write your thesis to better fit the evidence you found, or do you need to find evidence that better fits your thesis?
Comments about Supporting Evidence, Development of Argument, or Essay Structure often indicate problems with understanding the relationship between quoted textual evidence and the specific point the writer wants to make.  However, such difficulties can also be symptomatic of a more fundamental problem with a conceptually weak Thesis.
Comments about Language and Sentence Level Errors should be the last areas you address.  You may find that many of these problems disappear once you begin addressing other issues.

8. Based on the responses and suggestions made by your group, write three specific strategies for revision in the space below.  List them according to priority.  Be specific.  Identify what you plan to revise, why it needs revision, and how you plan to revise it (e.g., “Because the last two sentences in paragraph two introduce a new idea, I will remove them and develop them into a new paragraph.”). Turn in this sheet with your final draft.

Sample 1: Peer Review Letter

Dear ____________________,

Thanks for letting me read your essay!  It looks like your thesis so far is:



There are some things about your essay that work really well for me.  First, on page ___, I like the way you:


Second, on page ___, I also like:



And then on page __, 



There are also some things that I think you can strengthen about the essay before you turn it in.  
First, on page ___, you can [for example: clarify, explain, support, analyze…]


Also, on page __, 



And then on page ___, 



Another thought I have about your essay is:


Sincerely,

Sample 2: Peer Revision Letter

Since you will have a few days to read over and reflect on your peer’s paper, I would like you to type up a brief note to your peer outlining your major impressions of the paper.  Please include the following:

Summarize what you believe to be the main point of the paper (it will be helpful for your peer to see if it is coming across as he/she meant it to) and assess how well he/she proves it throughout the paper.

Considering such things as content, organization, flow, clarity, and format, state at least two major strengths of the paper.  If there is any way these can be made even stronger, give suggestions.

State at least two things in the paper that you think need improvement, and suggest how these improvements could be made.

Since you will be discussing your impressions with your partner on Friday, I don’t expect this to be too long; you can give the details in person.  This will just give your partner something on paper to refer back to as he/she revises.

Requirements:
A length of approximately ½-1 page, single-spaced
Bring two copies, one for me and one for your peer
Due Date:

Instructor-Led Peer Conferencing: An Introduction

Definition:   Peer conferencing is a type of peer response activity in which a small group of students (typically three to four) meets with an instructor to discuss drafts and make suggestions for revision.  The primary difference between peer conferencing and other forms of peer response is the extent to which the instructor actively participates in the group process.  In traditional peer response groups, the instructor supervises from outside the group.  In peer conferencing, the instructor participates inside the group as both a facilitator and respondent.  It is not a group advising session in which the instructor takes turns commenting on each student’s paper while the others look on; it is a collaborative process in which the student writer, the peers, and the instructor all engage in a give-and-take of ideas.  

Features: 
3-4 students, plus instructor
Students read and prepare comments on peers’ papers before the conference session
The instructor reads and prepares comments on student papers before the conference session
For each student paper the group spends 12-15 minutes commenting and offering suggestions
The student peers are primarily responsible for providing feedback on the student’s essay
The instructor is primarily responsible for managing group process and being available as a resource, but also takes turns as a respondent
The instructor typically waits to make her comments until after all of the student peers have spoken  

Purposes: 
To give the instructor more direct oversight of the peer response process
To encourage more student participation and higher quality feedback
To help students identify the features of effective academic writing and apply these standards to their own work

Benefits:
Instructor’s presence improves quality of drafts and peer comments
Every student has direct time with the instructor
Presence of peers diffuses instructor’s authority (or rather, instructor and peers mutually reinforce each other’s authority)
Another venue in which instructor can know students
Instructor saves time writing long comments on drafts that can be more efficiently delivered in person
Instructor learns how students are thinking about material and acquires new ways of creating a common discourse

Challenges:
Coordinating schedules
Potentially more time-intensive, with the following mitigating factors:
-tendency to spend less time commenting on drafts
-less time in individual conferences/more productive additional conferences
Grading participation and quality of feedback
Using interpersonal skills to manage a session

Instructor’s roles:
Initiator: (To peers) “Who would like to be first?”  “Let’s get started by focusing on the thesis statement, which seems to be the crucial task of assignment number one.”  
Inviter: (To peer) “Sam, do you also have a specific comment about this topic sentence?”   “I noticed that you have a lot of comments in the margins of page four, Sunny.  Do you want to share some of them with us?” (To writer) “Now that you have heard our comments, what do you think you will do to revise your essay?”
Clarifier/Questioner: (To peer) “You say that the essay has no thesis statement.  Why do you think the last sentence in the first paragraph does not qualify as a thesis statement?”  (To writer) “In your thesis statement you say X is true, but in your final paragraph you say Y is true.  Talk to us about which statement you think you should keep for your next draft.”
Elaborator: (To everyone) “I agree with the comments so far about the disorganization in the paper, and I think I can see the cause: the thesis statement, rather than making an argument, instead lists three topics to be discussed.  Because the argument has no logical arrangement, it’s impossible to know how the paragraphs should be organized.”
Summarizer: (To everyone) “I noticed that when Sherry commented on the conclusion, everyone nodded—including me!  It seems pretty obvious that revising the conclusion should be a pretty high priority.”
Modeler (To peers) “I noticed that Judy’s warrant in paragraph three lacked specific language analysis.  Are there other paragraphs whose warrants are not developed?
Encourager: (To everyone) “All of your ideas for how to improve this essay are right on.  You all have great instincts!”  “You can see from this essay how important transitions can be.  Use some of the ideas we’ve talked about here on your own essays.”
SAMPLE ASSIGNMENTS


These four sample assignments, taken from four different topic assignment sequences, demonstrate how the essays you assign can be crafted to fit different topics. For more topic assignments, and full assignments sequences for each topic, visit the Qwriting site at http://qwriting.org/.


Assignment #1: Primary Source Argument (from “Beauty” topic)

Write an essay in which you make an argument about Edmund Burke’s definition of beauty. You should identify key passages and terms that you think are central to Burke’s definition and make an argument about how they work together to construct Burke’s conception.   

Audience: 	Those interested in Edmund Burke’s theories of beauty

Format: 	1000 words (2-3 pages); MLA style

Deadlines:	Draft due in class for peer review on:  
Final draft due in class on:

Advice:	Having studied and closely read some of Burke’s writing you should be quite familiar with his characterization of beauty. Your aim should be to “own” Burke’s definition of beauty—to know it so well that you may as well have written yourself. Think carefully about how you will structure your essay. What is the most important aspect of Burke’s definition? The answer to that question will be the central point around which you build your argument. 

(FOR INSTRUCTORS ONLY)

Type:	Analyze a single primary source to support an arguable thesis.

Pre-Draft Activities:
1 Excerpts from Burke’s Enquiry will be read together and discussed several times to prepare students for this assignment. Students will be able to and required to summarize Burke’s definition of beauty in their own words before embarking on their first draft.
2 Paper outline with feedback from instructor
3 Thesis group/class work
4 First draft and final draft cover letters to classmate and instructor, respectively



Assignment #2: Analysis: Comics and Public Events (from “Visual World” topic)

In this essay, you will compare representations of public events in comics and in traditional journalistic writing. Your task is to present an argument for the effectiveness of one medium over another in representing the event based on analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each source for representing what Tim O’Brien terms the “story truth” of the event.

Audience: 	General public and media scholars interested in the event

Format: 	1200 words (4-5 pages); MLA style, including in-text citations and Works Cited page

Deadlines:	Draft due in class for peer review on:  
Final draft due in class on: 

Advice:	The best essays will provide a clear description of the public event, a clear explanation of O’Brien’s concept of “story truth,” and detailed analysis of the aspects of the event emphasized by the comic and by the traditional journalistic source. Your argument for which source represents the event more effectively should be grounded in your understanding of the event’s “story truth.”


(FOR INSTRUCTORS ONLY) 

Type:	Develop an argument to analyze the tension you see between two sources

Rationale: 	The purpose of this assignment is to build on the skills of visual and verbal interpretation students practiced in the first essay and to introduce the research process, including accessing traditional journalistic writing using library resources and the Web. Students will practice quotation, paraphrase and summary and will be introduced to in-text citation and the requirements of a Works Cited page. The instructor should provide a library of comics that represent public events selected from political cartoons and graphic novels.

Pre-Draft Activities:
1 In-class writing and discussion of the messages conveyed by political cartoons and graphic novels;
2 Annotating and discussing background texts on the elements of comics (McCloud and Eisner) and on O’Brien’s concept of “story truth;”
3 Identifying and accessing library research sources such as LexisNexis and the New York Times archive, including a visit to the library and follow-up sessions in class;
4 Practicing paraphrasing and summarizing sources, and incorporating quotes in student’s own writing;
5 In-class writing and peer review focused on incorporating sources and developing clear arguments;
6 Practicing in-text citations and formatting entries for a Works Cited page



Assignment #3: Testing a Theory (from “Cultural Identity” topic)

Family organization, language, and religious beliefs influence the ideas and values expressed through art and literature in and across various communities. The texts we’ve been discussing in class offer different accounts of how these factors influence cultural expression and interaction. Your task is this assignment is to use either Hall’s theory of “cultural production” or Pratt’s theory of “contact zones” to compare two of the literary texts we have discussed in class.

Audience: 	Scholars interested in cultural identity, including Stuart Hall and Mary Louise Pratt

Format: 	1200 words (4-5 pages); MLA style, including in-text citations and Works Cited page

Deadlines:	Draft due in class for peer review on: 
Final draft due in class on: 

Advice:	The best essays will provide a thorough summary of either Hall’s theory of cultural production or Pratt’s theory of contact zones using summary, paraphrase and quotation; will explain how the theory applies to each of the literary texts under analysis; and will anticipate counter-arguments. You should be able to describe the relationship you see between the literary texts in one focused sentence.


(FOR INSTRUCTORS ONLY) 

Type:	Use a secondary source as a lens to analyze a primary source, and support your thesis with evidence

Rationale: 	The purpose of this assignment is to give students practice summarizing, paraphrasing and otherwise engaging theories of cultural identity. Students apply their understanding of others’ ideas to fictional texts rather than to their own lives in preparation for the culminating research paper.

Pre-Draft Activities:
1 Annotation and analysis of Pratt's and Hall’s essays
2 Practice with framing quotations in order to apply other’s ideas to student’s own
3 Developing and reinforcing thesis statements through structure, analysis, reflection and consideration of counter-arguments
4 Practicing in-text citations and formatting entries for a Works Cited page
5 Outlining/Planning a comparative analysis



Assignment #4: Dramaturgical Research Essay (from “Page to Stage” topic)

In this culminating essay assignment you will extend your engagement with the play you evaluated in your Why This Play Now essay by applying skills of textual and thematic analysis and academic research. Your task is to analyze the play’s production history through a particular question that provides a means for assessing its relevance today. 

The first stage of your work on the essay will be conducting research using library collections and databases. Through your research, you will create an annotated bibliography that lists at least 10 academic sources and provides a 100-word summary for each source describing how it relates to your claim about the play’s production history. The second stage of your work on the essay will be preparing a draft for peer review and revision. You must bring to bear at least 5 academic sources in the final draft of your essay. 

Audience: 	Scholars interested in the play

Format: 	Annotated Bibliography: 10 sources with 100-word summaries; MLA Works Cited entries
Essay: 1500 words (5-6 pages); MLA style, including in-text citations and Works Cited page

Deadlines:	Annotated Bibliography due in class on: 
Draft due in class for peer review on:  
Final draft due in class on:

Advice:	The best essays will focus on a single guiding question that allows you to make a claim about the play’s relevance today. Questions you might consider include: Where/When has the play been performed? Which actors or theater troupes have performed it? How has it been staged or adapted over time? What did critics say about it when it was first performed? How has critical reception of the play changed over time?

(FOR INSTRUCTORS ONLY) 

Type:	Develop an analytical argument using original research that includes both primary and secondary sources

Rationale: 	The purpose of this assignment is to engage students in significant library research and to encourage them to practice synthesizing information gathered from various sources. Students apply their emerging understandings of textual features, thematic and performance elements of plays in light of the course’s main guiding question, how does a written text become a living, shared moment in the performance space? 

Pre-Draft Activities:
1 Practice annotating primary and secondary sources and organizing evidence using an outline (like the Performance Review Outline)
2 Library session focused on identifying and interpreting relevant research sources, including critical analyses, historical and contemporary reviews, and primary sources such as photographs and videos of live performances;
3 Prepare an annotated bibliography that summarizes the usefulness of sources gathered through library research
4 Practice in-text citations and formatting entries for a Works Cited page
