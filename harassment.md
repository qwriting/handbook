# Sexual Harassment

According to the University’s Policy Against Sexual Harassment, “It is the policy of the City University of New York to promote a cooperative work and academic environment in which there exists mutual respect for all CUNY students, faculty, and staff. Harassment of employees or students based upon sex is inconsistent with this objective and contrary to the CUNY’s nondiscrimination policy. Sexual harassment is illegal under federal, state, and city laws, and will not be tolerated within CUNY.”

As teachers, we must not tolerate such harassment should it occur at any time in our classrooms, whether directed at us or at another student.  Nor should we tolerate a student’s harassing behavior toward us outside the classroom.  Perhaps of greatest importance, we must never take advantage of our position of authority to force students to endure such harassment themselves.

Formal harassment complaints may be initiated in consultation with the head of the Department of English.
