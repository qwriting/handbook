# Topics-based Curriculum and Assignment Sequences

We design our assignments around a skeletal form that is shared by every section of College Writing 1.  The program asks each instructor to create a “Course Overview” that makes this sequence evident. The overviews are designed to emphasize particular elements of writing and demonstrate how writing assignments give students practice with these elements. In addition, the overviews demonstrate how the goals that students achieve in earlier reading and writing assignments enable them to meet the requirements of later, more complex assignments. The content of each course varies with the topics, so the assignments vary accordingly, too, with this structure in common. Appendix IV of this handbook contains four sample assignments (page 102), and the [Qwriting site](http://english110.qwriting.org) provides course overviews, assignment sequences, syllabi, and other resources. 

Because we work to give our students a common language for talking about writing across the disciplines, we write our assignments to articulate the intellectual work that each essay requires. More about our approach to writing assignments follows in this section. Another great resource is [Kerry Walk’s “Teaching with Writing”](http://www.princeton.edu/writing/university/resources/TWW.pdf).

Students in this course write four formal essays, of which at least three resemble essays that they would write in a General Education course.  One of those essays entails original research, and all of them enable students to practice a writing process that includes pre-drafts and revisions.  Students’ written and oral conversations with each other and their instructor inform those revisions.

The assignments can be sequenced in one of two ways.

Option 1: All four formal assignments give students practice in common forms of scholarly writing.

Essay 1: Analyze a single primary source to support an arguable thesis.

Essay 2: Develop an argument to analyze the tension you see between two sources (either two primary sources, or one primary and one secondary).

Essay 3: Use a secondary source as a lens to analyze a primary source, and support your thesis with evidence.

Essay 4: Develop an analytical argument using original research that includes both primary and secondary sources.

Option 2: Three of the four formal essays give students practice in scholarly writing.  The fourth gives students an opportunity to present scholarly evidence to an audience that is specified (e.g., readers of The New Yorker; policymakers considering an issue of relevance to the course; scholars in the field of anthropology).  

Essay 1: Analyze a single primary source to support an arguable thesis.

Essay 2: Use a secondary source to analyze a primary source, and support your thesis with evidence.

Essay 3: Develop an analytical argument using original research that includes both primary and secondary sources.

Essay 4: Present your research within the conventions of a particular genre (e.g., an annotated bibliography, an op-ed piece, a review essay, a personal essay) that is particularly relevant to the course topic.
