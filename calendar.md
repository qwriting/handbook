# Course Calendar

We suggest that you be as specific as possible in your course calendar.  It is an important tool for students to visualize and plan for the semester. 

Best practices for the 110 course calendar:

- Include clear directions in the structure of the calendar (ex: “Read this”). New students are often confused by the fact that work is due on the day it is written on the syllabus (different from high school). Clear directions will help them navigate.
- Use visual clues to reinforce the organization of the calendar (bold, italics, bullets, spacing, etc.)
- Highlight the difference between different kinds of assignments (reading, writing, drafting, etc.)
- Link directly to readings from course calendar when possible. 
- Attribute texts in a consistent and clear way. 
- Clearly mark days when the class doesn’t meet, or when it meets in a different location (many students -- and teachers--have trouble getting used to the Friday/Monday thing at CUNY)

If you’re asking your students to meet you in the library, remind them on your syllabus to BRING THEIR ID and to have it enabled by the front desk. In our experience, many first years don’t enter the library until their English 110 instructor requires them to do so.  They will not be able to get through the door without having their card enabled. (This is one reason why it’s smart to physically bring them to the library early in the semester to have their cards enabled, and then return later in the semester for an ‘official’ library visit.)
