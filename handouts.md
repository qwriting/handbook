# Making Handouts

Many teachers create their own handouts to meet the specific needs of a class.  Most then keep these on file and use them for years.  You can design a resource handout that explains a concept (like thesis statements) and provides examples, paper assignments, and in-class exercises.  If students have difficulty with, say, spotting the passive voice, a brief handout might identify those problems particular to your class.  When you want to design a handout, you should quickly check with your colleagues, the English 110 website, or a few textbooks for supplementary information that the texts you’re using may not include.

Be as concise as possible, and gear your own style to your student audience (clear, simple sentences, numbered examples, etc.). If you take the time and trouble to design a handout, stress to your students that they’re responsible for reading it.  Many teachers make handouts because this helps them to focus material, to structure class, and to formalize for themselves what they know about a certain topic.  However, while handouts are a most useful teaching aid, never feel compelled to make them unless you see a clear purpose for so doing.  A blizzard of handouts will just numb your students, and thus become counterproductive. As noted earlier, it might be useful to put these documents on a course blog or Blackboard, so students can refer to these supplementary materials online.
