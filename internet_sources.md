# A Note on Internet Sources

Some instructors, motivated partly by fears of plagiarism and partly by recognition that students must learn to use print resources, limit the number of Internet resources students can use, or even ban them.  Since our goal is to teach students to research widely, effectively, and efficiently, imposing bans or limits on Internet resources may be counter-productive.  Web sites published by Federal agencies provide a wealth of valuable information, the Internet is increasingly the site of scholarly activity, and many Web sites might be used as the object of extended analysis.  If you worry about student propensities to rely too heavily on electronic sources, stipulate that the research paper must use a certain number of print sources, and explain the reasons for this requirement to your students. As many have argued, the Internet offers writing instructors a fine opportunity to teach source analysis and evaluationâ€”principles that apply to print sources as well.
