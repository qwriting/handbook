# Sample Rubric 1

(Adapted from the “Official Scoring Guide: Arizona’s Instrument to Measure Standards”)

In order to earn a grade of C, a paper must fulfill all of the stated content and format requirements for the assignment.  Beyond this basic requirement, grades reflect the standards described below.

A papers will possess all of the following characteristics:

Clear, focused, and interesting content suited to audience and purpose
Organization that is effective and easy to follow, including a strong introduction and conclusion and smooth, effective transitions
Sentences that show a high degree of craftsmanship, with consistently strong and varied structure

Exceptionally strong control of standard writing conventions: errors so few and so minor that the reader can easily skim right over them unless specifically searching for them

B papers may fulfill many of the A paper characteristics, with possible difference(s) such as:

Clear and focused content suited to audience and purpose
Predictable organization, introduction and conclusion adequate, transitions present 

Strong control over simple sentences, but variable control over more complex sentences

Occasional lapses in correct grammar and usage

C papers may parallel a few A paper characteristics and/or many B paper characteristics, with possible difference(s) such as (but not limited to):

Easily identifiable purpose and main ideas, but lacking focus and/or clarity

Somewhat unclear or under-developed, despite attempts at organization
Little control of complex sentences; repetitive sentence patterns; ineffective fragments

Errors in grammar and usage that do not block meaning but do distract the reader, or some control over conventions in a text that is too simple to reveal mastery

D papers may parallel many of the C paper characteristics, with possible difference(s) such as (but not limited to):

Fulfilling only some of the stated requirements
Ideas that are somewhat unclear, minimally developed or cluttered with irrelevant details

A lack of effective organizational structure which leaves the reader confused

A significant number of sentences that are awkward, choppy, or rambling
Errors in grammar and usage that interfere with readability and meaning

F papers may be deficient in that they:

Fulfill few or none of the stated requirements

Lack a central idea or purpose

Are not clearly organized

Contain sentence structure that frequently obscures meaning 

Demonstrate very limited skill in using conventions
