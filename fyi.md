# Learning Communities/FYI

The Freshman Year Initiative is a unique program that brings entering students together in two thematically linked courses during their first semester at Queens College. FYI communities link a General Education Perspectives course and an English 110 course. One or both of your English 110s may be in an FYI community, which means all of the students in your class will also be enrolled in the same General Education class.  In addition to providing a social connection for students new to college, the communities also introduce students to the concept of interdisciplinarity, as they explore the ways in which different fields engage in intellectual inquiry of subject matter in different ways.  Ideally, instructors from the two classes will share syllabi and other information about their courses and their respective classrooms, and may choose to collaborate on readings, assignments, or a community event such as a field trip, a lecture, or a performance. Each community is assigned a community leader who will be in touch with you about these collaborations. Instructors are compensated for their work in an FYI community, and you should receive paperwork from the FYI office to get paid.  If you have any questions about payment, send an email with your question to Ann Davison (anndavisonqc@gmail.com), Susan Braver (susan.braver@qc.cuny.edu), and Marty Braun (martin.braun@qc.cuny.edu).

# College Writing 2 (a.k.a. English Composition 2) 

### English Composition 2 According to Pathways

Under Pathways, Queens College has the mandate to create a second composition class that has these learning outcomes:

- Read and listen critically and analytically, including identifying an argument’s major assumptions and assertions and evaluating its supporting evidence.
- Write clearly and coherently in varied, academic formats (such as formal essays, research papers, and reports) using standard English and appropriate technology to critique and improve one’s own and others’ texts.
- Demonstrate research skills using appropriate technology, including gathering, evaluating, and synthesizing primary and secondary sources.
- Support a thesis with well-reasoned arguments, and communicate persuasively across a variety of contexts, purposes, audiences, and media.
- Formulate original ideas and relate them to the ideas of others by employing the conventions of ethical attribution and citation.

# College Writing 2 (CW2) at Queensn

Although this mandate comes from beyond Queens College, we aim to use it to support our ongoing efforts to strengthen our curriculum by linking writing instruction more closely with General Education.  In that spirit, we call it “College Writing” rather than “English Composition,” and we frame it as the next logical step from the interdisciplinary work that our students do in English 110 (soon to be College Writing 1).  CW2 will teach students how to identify and practice the conventions of scholarly writing in a particular discipline.

To ensure that this discipline-specific work benefits students in every major, CW2 will be offered not only in the English Department, but in departments and divisions across campus.   Students will be encouraged to take their second writing course in a department that is in—or institutionally near—their major, so that they learn to gather and analyze evidence in the ways that their discipline values most.  Appropriate titles for CW2 might be: Writing About History; Writing About Biology; Writing About Literature, for example.

CW2 is distinguishable from CW1 by its disciplinary lens, and it is distinguishable from gateway courses in the majors by its attention to writing.  Students in every section of CW2 will attend to writing in class in one or more of the following possible forms: a) discussion of papers before they are written and after they are returned; b) reading aloud of successful papers or models; c) discussion of the rhetorical strategies or writerly qualities of course readings; d) the occasional use of informal, ungraded writing to stimulate class discussion.
