# FERPA

If a parent, guardian, or any other family member or friend asks for information about a student’s grade or other progress in your class, you are required by law not to disclose if that student is over eighteen:   

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."  For more information, visit the [U.S. Department of Education's website on FERPA]( http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html).
