# Printing and Photocopying

Printing is available via the computers and printers in the adjunct office on the 6th floor of Klapper. Photocopying on the departmental copiers should be limited to smaller jobs. You will need a code to access these copiers; ask the English department main office personnel for a user name and password. 

For larger photocopying needs, use the reprographic services at [Speedy Q Printshop](https://printshop.qc.cuny.edu/DSF/storefront.aspx?6xni2of2cF3adb+7pAgBQDokgTW723roFPQ0pIhQDfLRl026EjDU7t/ftRS1VgNe/).
