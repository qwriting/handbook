# Observing Copyright

You may use materials from any textbook, reader, or other source provided that you do not violate the copyright law.

Copyright law allows you to make one copy of a copyrighted piece for each student in your class—

a. if the material copied is brief, and
b. if the copying isn’t done on a regular basis (is “spontaneous”) or as a substitute for buying textbooks or periodicals.

More specifically:

a. A piece of prose is sufficiently brief when it is either a complete article, story or essay of less than 2500 words, or an excerpt from a prose work of not more than 1000 words (or 10 percent of the work, whichever is less).

b. Copying is sufficiently “spontaneous” if the decision to use it and its actual use in class are too close for the teacher to write requesting permission from the publisher.

c. Not more than one short poem, article, or story or two excerpts may be copied from the same author, or more than three from the same collective work or periodical volume during one class term.

You may not do this multiple copying more than nine times per term for one course.

d. The same piece should not be copied from term to term by the same teacher.

e. (very important) Department-paid photocopying may not be done as a substitute for the purchase of textbooks, anthologies, compilations, or collective works.

In practical terms, the English Department will not photocopy materials in violation of copyright laws.
