There are a few points to remember when scheduling a class in the Library:</p><p>Please give the Library two weeks advance notice when requesting a particular Library session date. It is a good idea to have an alternate date in mind, in case the Library classrooms on the date you want are already taken.</p><p>The library sessions are most successful when the librarian is given the assignment at the time you are scheduling the class, so that he/she can plan and tailor the instruction to it. The generic classes with no assignment given tend to be less successful, both for the students and the librarian.</p><p>Due to the amount of information the librarians need to teach the students and the limited time available, Library tours are not given during the session. Instead, we request you tell your students to explore the Library website on their own, with its <a href="http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/Library/information/maps.php/" target="_blank">explanatory text and Maps</a> to learn about our services and collections. When a physical tour is preferred, the Library will arrange such tours outside of the library session, through the Instructional Services Office upon request of the instructor.</p><p>Instructors are expected to remain with the class during the duration of the Library session.</p><p>Please tell your students to meet you directly at your designated Library classroom at the appointed day/time.</p><p>As a general rule, the faculty can expect the librarians to cover:</p><ol><li>general orientation to the Library (service points, hours, where to do for help, stacks/call numbers for locating material)
</li>
<li>library homepage and its organization
</li>
<li>connecting from off campus 
</li>
<li>distinguishing between popular magazines and scholarly journals
</li>
<li>choosing a topic, broadening/ narrowing, Boolean searching,  keyword and subject searching
</li>
<li>CUNY+ catalog ( locating books/e-books/journals in the catalog, CLICS service, My Account)
</li>
<li>finding e-Journals 
</li>
<li>periodical databases--identifying and performing searches in Academic Search Complete, Lexis Nexis (other as appropriate)
</li>
<li>Evaluating information sources critically
</li>
<li>Lab time 
</li></ol>
<p>Instructional Services Office (RO 224) is open Monday to Friday, 10am to 2pm.</p><p>To schedule a Library session contact:</p><p>Ms. Angela Rao<br>

<p>Materials may be submitted in paper format, or in an electronic format (Word, Excel, PDF, HTML)&#x2014;either on diskette, CD, or as email attachments.</p><p>Lengthy documents will be broken into smaller parts to minimize downloading and printing time.</p><p>Reserve will NOT scan/place entire books on the E-Res site.</p><h3 id="e-journale-book-links">E-Journal/E-Book Links</h3><p>When an article is available in one of our electronic journals, instructors should indicate the appropriate database in their syllabus instead of placing the article on reserve. Reserve processing staff will review reading lists to determine if Rosenthal Library has electronic access to articles. Electronic journals are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (off-campus use requires setting up access through the QC proxy server; click here for proxy server setup instructions). To find out if the Library owns an e-journal search the list of E-Periodicals (A-Z).</p><p>If you find that a book you want to place on reserve is part of our netLibrary e-book collection, your students will be able to access it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from any Internet-connected computer provided they have set up an account. In order to set up an account one must visit netLibrary from a computer on campus. The username and password created may be used both on and off campus.</p><h3 id="confirmation">Confirmation</h3><p>Staff does not send confirmation regarding the receipt or status of the request. All instructors are encouraged to view the E-Res site to check on the availability of the requested material prior to assigning it to their students.</p><h3 id="requested-semester-only">Requested Semester Only</h3><p>Material placed on Reserve will remain there for the requested semester only. Unless you request otherwise, all material will be removed from Reserve at the end of the semester: E-Res documents will be archived, Library material will be returned to stacks, and personal material will be returned to faculty.</p><h3 id="password-protection">Password Protection</h3><p>Passwords will be assigned for every course page. It will be the instructor&apos;s responsibility to disseminate the password to the students. Staff will not distribute passwords to students.</p><h3 id="copyright-guidelines">Copyright Guidelines</h3><p>The Library will comply with the current Copyright Guidelines for CUNY Libraries. Where materials do not fall within fair use, they may still be placed on Reserve providing permission is being sought from the copyright holder. The Library reserves the right not to accept materials for Reserve if it judges that the nature, scope or extent of the material is beyond the reasonable limits of fair use, and will not knowingly accept materials that violate copyright law. Where the faculty member has not already secured permission, the Library will work to a reasonable extent to obtain copyright clearance for material the Library places on E-Res. The Library will only pay limited permission fees. Instructors who manage their own E-Res course site must obtain copyright clearance for material they place on their site. Some material is prohibitively expensive to place on reserve electronically; in such cases, the Library will try to purchase a print copy.</p><h3 id="course-paks">Course Paks</h3><p>Faculty who wish to re-use copyrighted material for more than one semester or to place large numbers of copyrighted articles/chapters on E-Res might want to consider ordering a Course Pak through the QC Bookstore. Contact the Textbook Manager at 718-997-3570 for more information.</p><h3 id="course-management-by-the-library">Course Management by the Library</h3><p>The Library will place material on reserve at the request of the instructor for the educational use of students. Free electronic access will be limited to the instructor and students. A copyright notice&#x2014;for photocopied material and electronic material&#x2014;will be available for each item. Access to material will be removed at the end of the semester.</p><h3 id="course-management-by-you">Course Management by You</h3><p>Faculty wishing to manage their own E-Res course site must provide Reserve Processing Staff with a completed and signed Course Management Application. This includes assuming responsibility for copyright for the items you place on your E-Res course site. The following can be used as guidelines for copyright compliance: Copyright Policies and Guidelines for CUNY Libraries.</p><h3 id="media-center">Media Center</h3><p>The Multimedia Commons houses a variety of material, equipment, and facilities. Laptops for use by Queens College students can be borrowed here, and the Library&apos;s DVD, VHS and CD-ROM audio, video, and digital text collections are housed and screened on the media viewing workstations here. Microforms can be paged and used in this area and assistance is provided for the adjacent Educational Curriculum Center. We are open at all times the Rosenthal Library is open.</p><h3 id="videofilm-request-template">Video/Film Request Template</h3><p>For use by Queens College Faculty only</p><p>Please use this template to request videos for classroom showing from any CUNY library including Queens College. NOTE: Some CUNY Schools do not lend their video titles.</p><p>All video requests must be submitted at least 3 weeks in advance.</p><p>Please keep in mind that the probability of obtaining a film outside of the CUNY consortium is significantly lower than acquiring them from a CUNY school.</p><p>If for any reason Media is unable to process a film request, you will be notified within 5 business days.</p><p>When your film has arrived you will receive an email stating when you can pick up the video.</p><p>Remember to reserve desired classroom equipment with OIT, Kiely 183. 718-997-5960.</p><p>Please send an email with the subject line titled &quot;Video Request Form&quot; to qc_libav@qc.cuny.edu providing the following information: Name, Department, E-mail, Phone #, 14 digit Library ID, Video Title(s), CUNY Library: Optional, Call #: Optional, Requested Showdate, Alternate Showdate, Comments: Optional (e.g.: Director, Actor/Actress, Description, etc.).
