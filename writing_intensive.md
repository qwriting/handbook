# Writing Intensive Classes

Courses are designated W (“Writing Intensive”) by the Academic Senate, on the recommendation of the Undergraduate Curriculum Committee (UCC) and its Writing Intensive Subcommittee (WISC). To be considered for the W designation, a course must meet the following four criteria:

10-15 pages of evaluated writing in three or more assignments (either separate papers or one term paper done in stages) so that students have the opportunity to develop and improve.

Some attention to writing in class, in one or more of the following possible forms:

- discussion of papers before they are written and after they are returned.
- reading aloud of successful papers or models.
- discussion of the rhetorical strategies or writerly qualities of course readings.
- the use of informal, ungraded writing to stimulate class discussion
- peer editing: opportunities for students to give each other feedback on first drafts.
- discussion of goals for student writing and evaluation criteria.
- Exams [if given] that include essay questions.
- Maximum class-size of 30 students (NOTE: as of Spring 2010, the enrollment for W courses is capped at 25)
