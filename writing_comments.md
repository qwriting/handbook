# Writing Comments

Of course your students will be most concerned with the bottom line, the grade at the end of the paper.  But even more important, from our perspective, are the comments you write to tell your students how well they have done and where their papers could use some rewriting.  

Paper comments fall into two categories: marginal comments throughout the essay, and the summarizing end comments.  Ideally, they serve different purposes.

Marginal comments.  Use marginal and between-sentence comments to point out strengths and weaknesses of individual sentences, point out one or two carefully selected grammatical problems, praise a particularly strong piece of diction, etc.  If you begin to see the same problem throughout the essay —say, lack of concrete examples to support analysis—you can put a check mark next to each paragraph and write “see end comment.”  Marginal comments can be descriptive as well as evaluative: you can use them, for example, to show how the paper creates and fulfills (or fails to fulfill) the expectations of the reader.

End comments.  Use end comments to summarize the success(es) of the paper and to point out problem areas or developing strengths in the student’s writing that he or she should be aware of for the next essay.

When you write an end comment, consider your overall impression of the writing: How well does it answer the specific demands of the assignment?  Could you follow the writer’s argument from the beginning of the essay to the end?  If not, where and why did the writer lose you?  What is good about the paper?  Begin your end comments with these strengths.

Both marginal comments and end comments require you to be as specific in your diagnosis of students’ writing as you ask them to be in their essays.  For example, a comment like “Your opening paragraphs are good, but later they become vague” is not very helpful, because it indicates only that you approved of some paragraphs and disapproved of others.  Explain why the opening paragraphs are good and how exactly paragraph eight conveys vagueness to you as a reader.  

It is inevitable that you will begin to use rhetorical jargon in your comments (“transitions,” “paragraph coherence,” “static thesis”) or your own terms for certain problems or successes.  But make sure your students know what your shorthand means by defining those words in context.  Avoid vaguely negative terms such as awkward and vague.  Instead choose more specific, rewrite-focused language such as “needs more examples.”

Always make it clear to students that you will be happy to explain your comments if they do not understand them.
