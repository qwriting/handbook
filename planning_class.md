# Planning Your Class

As the semester quickly approaches, planning an entire course can seem overwhelming. It is important to keep in mind that you may not want to plan every unit in detail prior to the start of the semester. The syllabus, no matter how carefully planned, is likely to be changed as you adjust to the needs of your students and your goals for the course.  On the other hand, you certainly will want to have some firm plans before you start the semesterâ€™s teaching. As you plan your course, you should do the following:

Establish Course Goals. It is important that all instructors understand these goals as a fundamental component of the First Year Writing program at Queens College. Goals should be assessable by a paper, an exam, or some other assignment, but you do not have to specify the means of assessment on the syllabus. The ten Learning Goals for English 110 are listed on page 12. Instructors usually choose to represent a smaller number of these goals on a syllabus, or adapt them to suit their courses. Following the Learning Goals are some examples of goals from past English 110 syllabi (page 13). This should help you see the ways that the general goals can be adapted into specific goals for your course.

- stablish the sequence of skills you will teach in each unit
- Decide how or if you will revise the sample course(s) for your topic (further information on the topics-based English 110 courses is on page 15). Determine the essays you will assign, the percentage of the grade they will count for, and due dates for the assignments and possible revision dates
- Plan your first unit of the semester in detail with formal writing assignment, pre-draft assignments and readings.
