# Appendix VI: English 130

CW2 in the English Department: ENG 130
Students who elect to take CW2 in the English Department will learn how to engage with other scholars in meaningful conversations about literature.   Building methods that they will continue to practice throughout their coursework, they will become more able to:

-Create arguable theses about literary texts.
-Support their theses with close reading.
-Marshal primary and secondary sources for textual analysis.
-Find, cite, and evaluate sources using appropriate research tools.
-Deploy critical terms effectively.
-Converse with other scholars in the field, orally and in writing.	

A Shared Form with Varying Content
The content of ENG 130 will vary greatly from one section to the next, but the form will be shared throughout the department.  Students in ENG 130 will:
	- write three essays that build in complexity, plus a research assignment and a portfolio.  
	- revise each essay in conversation with each other and their instructor.

Essay 1: Close reading of a text using selected literary terms.

Essay 2: Close reading of a text in the context of a theoretical or historical source.

Essay 3: Close reading of a text in the context of at least two secondary sources that the student finds through research.

Research Assignment: An annotated bibliography with at least five relevant sources, produced en route to Essay 3. 

Portfolio: In a cover letter, students reflect on the writing practice they gained through their pre-drafts, drafts, and revisions over the course of the semester.

In the vocabulary of our existing curriculum, ENG 130 might:
	- Provide a missing link between ENG 110 and ENG 170; and 
	- Combine features of ENG 110, ENG 161, and ENG 165.

Goals
The reading and writing assignments in ENG 130 are designed to prepare students for the diversity of assignments that await them in upper-division English classes.  The primary aim of the course is to help students identify and practice the conventions that experienced scholars use to think more critically about literary texts.  


OVERVIEW OF A SAMPLE ASSIGNMENT SEQUENCE

Unit 1: Close reading of a single text (Draft + Revision: 4 weeks)
Reading Assignment: Three poems from different periods that contain quoted or reported speech:
		Elizabeth Bishop, “In the Waiting Room”
		Vijay Sashadri, “Bright Copper Kettles”
		W. B. Yeats, “The Second Coming”

Writing Assignment: Identify an interpretive problem in one of these poems and develop a thesis that addresses it.  Use one of the literary terms you’ve learned as a keyterm to analyze the text and support your thesis with close reading.  (4-5 pp.)
		
	Writing Lessons: 
		Thesis: Begin from a textual ambiguity to generate an arguable thesis
		Motive: Name the interpretive problem in the thesis
		Evidence and Analysis: Use close reading to open a poem to multiple 						interpretations and support a thesis; use a keyterm to drive analysis.  Quote, 				paraphrase, and cite sources effectively in MLA format.
	
	Literary Terms:
		Voice, Tone
		Line, Meter
		Character, Narrator
		Quotation		
		Indirect Speech, Reported Speech

	Pre-draft Assignment: (2-3 pp. informal response en route to the essay)
Quote a short passage from the poem whose meaning or significance is unclear to you, and write a response that identifies exactly how and where this writer loses you.  Refer to the text to show what you mean, and make at least two reasonable guesses about the meaning of the lines that you quote.  In which moments do your guesses seem plausible, and what questions remain? 

UNIT 2: Close reading of a single text in context (Draft + Revision: 5 weeks)
Reading Assignment: A Greek tragedy and a short article (5 pp.) that situates tragic drama in the context of the nascent Greek polis.

	Sophocles, Antigone
	Jean-Pierre Vernant and Pierre Vidal-Naquet, “The Historical Moment of 			Tragedy in Ancient Greece”

Writing Assignment: Use close reading of Antigone to analyze its representation of justice, and historicize your argument using your secondary source.  (5-6 pp.)

	Writing Lessons: 
		Thesis: Practice using close reading to generate arguable theses 
		Motive: Illuminate a close reading with an historical source
		Evidence and Analysis: Practice close reading with increasing 							attention to the primary text, use a secondary text 						in ways that are appropriate to the argument.   Practice citation, paraphrase, and summary 		with respect to primary and secondary texts.	
	Literary Terms: 
		Tragedy, Epic, Chorus
		Narrative
		Genre, Form
		Hero, Protagonist
		Reception

	Pre-draft Assignment: (2-3 pp. informal response en route to the essay)
Refer to a passage in the play that seems to resonate in some way with what you learn from Vernant and Naquet.  Quote one sentence from each of the two texts at the top of the page, and then write a response to consider the relationship between the two.  How do the tensions that Vernant and Naquet describe appear in the play, and what questions might you raise about the way that they appear?

UNIT 3: Close reading of a primary text in context, with original research (Annotated Bibliography + Draft + Revision: 8 weeks)	
Reading Assignment: A short novel set in post-apartheid South Africa; a theoretical text about novelistic discourse and a video excerpt that provides historical context.  
 
	J. M. Coetzee, Disgrace
	Mikhail Bakhtin, “The Topic of the Speaking Person”
	South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission Hearings (video excerpt)

Writing Assignment: Make an argument that answers an interpretive question that you raise about Disgrace.  Support your argument with close reading, using secondary texts to define your terms precisely.  You might begin with the historical and theoretical texts that we studied in class, and you should also refer to at least two sources that you find through original research.  (8-10 pp.)

Annotated Bibliography Assignment:  As you revise your essay, annotate the bibliography that you created at our library session, indicating how your sources helped you and adding any new sources that you find.   (At least 8 sources; at least 5 pp.)

	
	Writing Lessons:  
Thesis: Identify a meaningful question for literary analysis and create an analytical frame 				for it, using historical and/or theoretical 	sources when they are useful.
		Motive: Make an argument for the significance of your thesis
		Evidence and Analysis: Use close reading to guide research, following inquiry toward 			evidence.  Evaluate sources in relationship to the thesis, prioritizing the most 			useful evidence and articulating its utility.  Continue to practice source use with 				original research.

	Literary Terms:
		Dialogue, Speech
		Protagonist, Minor character
		Narrative, Plot
		Prose
		Novel
		
	Post-draft Assignment: (2-3 pp. informal response en route to the essay)
Before your draft conference, reread your draft and put an X next to all of the places where your claims feel wobbly to you, particularly with respect to evidence.  Are there any places where you have to speculate about the historical context of the novel, or the literary devices that Coetzee uses, because you’re not sure you know what you’re talking about?  Write a letter to me explaining those holes in your evidence.  Do you have any sense of what kind of evidence you might need to fill them?	

Portfolio Assignment: Re-read all of your pre-drafts, drafts, and revisions as well as the feedback you received.  Put all of these documents in a folder and write a cover letter to present them.  In the letter, reflect on the ways that you’ve developed your critical faculties and practices this semester, and also on the ways that you’d like to continue that development in your future.
