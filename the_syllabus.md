# The Syllabus

On the first day of class, along with becoming acquainted with your students, you will distribute a syllabus that should include a schedule for the course (major topics/assignments/deadlines) as well as the course policies.  The course policies cover a wide array of important topics, including your contact information, office hours, and procedures regarding late, missed, or uncompleted work.  You should also include information about policies regarding academic honesty, respectful and non-discriminatory class discussion and accommodations for disabilities.

A clear and forceful explanation of these policies during the first day of class will help your students understand what you expect of them.  In discussing these policies, there are a few ground rules that you might want to place particular emphasis on:

Class Attendance: There are some general restrictions on how absences may affect a student’s grade.  Queens College does not have an attendance policy, and you cannot write in your syllabus that students will fail your course if they miss X number of classes. However, we do recommend that you have a participation policy, and you can tell students that poor attendance will reflect on their participation grade. If you think that a student has missed too many classes and thus missed a significant amount of in-class assignments, you can decide to fail the student on that basis. 

Instructors are encouraged to make their grading policies performance-based, so that absences affect the grade only insofar as participation, in-class exercises, and other activities are missed.  Under such a policy, you need only decide what criteria you will use to determine a student’s eligibility for makeup work. 

You need to make any policy about absences and lateness clear to students on your syllabus.  You should also make it clear whether your policy distinguishes between excused and unexcused absences.  If you do excuse absences, be sure that you have a clear policy for what gets excused and that you consistently implement that policy as stated.  In addition, maintain detailed and accurate records that reflect these policies.

Email: Because most new students have technologically integrated lives, it might be helpful, then, to articulate your views concerning email and its appropriate uses in conjunction with your course.  How often do you check/respond to email?  How do you expect email to be written (formal/informal)?  Will student work be accepted over email?  Conversely, if you intend to use email announcements/reminders/addendums to class time, you might also consider requesting information about your students’ familiarity with and access to the necessary technology.

Late work: In conjunction with the previous two topics, you will want to make sure that you have a set policy concerning late work.  Specify what assignments may be accepted late and what the penalty will be assigned to that work. You may also wish to outline particular policies about where and when work should be submitted.  For example, if a student misses class, is your mailbox or email an acceptable alternative?

Recitation Hour: Your syllabus should state the plan and the policy for the recitation hour, which is discussed in more detail on pp. 35.
